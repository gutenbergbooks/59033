<p class="dropcap">The process through which a man, who has made
himself remarkable to his ignorant fellow-men,
is passed after death—first, into the hero performing
fabulous exploits, and eventually into
the giant—is not difficult to understand.</p>

<p>The remembrance of great deeds, and the memory of
virtues,—even in modern days, when the exaggerations of
votaries are subdued by the influence of education,—ever
tends to bring them out in strong contrast with the surrounding
objects. The mass of men form the background,
as it were, of the picture, and the hero or the saint stands
forth in all his brightness of colour in the foreground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Amidst the uneducated Celtic population who inhabited
Old Cornwall, it was the practice, as with the Celts of other
countries, to exalt their benefactors with all the adornments
of that hyperbole which distinguishes their songs and stories.
When the first Christian missionaries dwelt amongst this
people, they impressed them with the daring which they
exhibited by the persecution which they uncomplainingly
endured and the holy lives they led.</p>

<p>Those who were morally so superior to the living men,
were represented as physically so to their children, and every
generation adorned the relation which it had received with
the ornaments derived from their own imaginations, which
had been tutored amidst the severer scenes of nature;
and consequently the warrior, or the holy man, was transmuted
into the giant.</p>

<p>If to this we add the desire which was constantly shewn
by the earlier priesthood to persuade the people of their
miraculous powers—of the direct interference of Heaven in
their behalf—and of the violent conflicts which they were
occasionally enduring with the enemy of the human race,
there will be no difficulty in marking out the steps by which
the ordinary man has become an extraordinary hero. When
we hear of the saints to whose memories the parish churches
are dedicated, being enabled to hurl rocks of enormous size
through the air, to carry them in their pockets, and indeed
to use them as playthings, we perceive that the traditions of
the legitimate giants, have been transferred to, and mixed up
with, the memories of a more recent people.</p>

<p>In addition to legends of the Titanic type, this section
will include a few of the true monastic character. The only
purpose I have in giving these is to preserve, as examples,
some curious superstitions which have not yet entirely lost
their hold on the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading2">THE CROWZA STONES.</h3>

<p>St Just, from his home in Penwith, being weary of
having little to do, except offering prayers for the tinners
and fishermen, went on a visit to the hospitable St
Keverne, who had fixed his hermitage in a well-selected
spot, not far from the Lizard headland. The holy brothers
rejoiced together, and in full feeding and deep drinking
they pleasantly passed the time. St Just gloried in the
goodly chalice from which he drank the richest of wines,
and envied St Keverne the possession of a cup of such rare
value. Again and again did he pledge St Keverne; their
holy bond of brotherhood was to be for ever; Heaven was
to witness the purity of their friendship, and to the world
they were to become patterns of ecclesiastical love.</p>

<p>The time came when St Just felt he must return to
his flock; and repeating over again his vows, and begging
St Keverne to return his visit, he departed—St Keverne
sending many a blessing after his good brother.</p>

<p>The Saint of the west, had not left his brother of the
south, many hours before the latter missed his cup. Diligent
search was made in every corner of his dwelling, but no
cup could be found. At length St Keverne could not but
feel that he had been robbed of his treasure by his western
friend. That one in whom he had placed such confidence—one
to whom he had opened his heart, and to whom he had
shewn the most unstinting hospitality—should have behaved
so treacherously, overcame the serenity of the good man.
His rage was excessive. After the first burst was over, and
reason reasserted her power, St Keverne felt that his wisest
course was to pursue the thief, inflict summary punishment
on him, and recover his cup. The thought was followed by
a firm resolve, and away St Keverne started in pursuit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
St Just. Passing over Crowza Down, some of the boulders
of “Ironstone” which are scattered over the surface caught
his eye, and presently he whipped a few of these stone
pebbles into his pockets, and hastened onward.</p>

<p>When he drew near Tre-men-keverne he spied St Just.
St Keverne worked himself up into a boiling rage, and toiled
with increased speed up the hill, hallooing to the saintly
thief, who pursued his way for some time in the well-assumed
quiet of conscious innocence.</p>

<p>Long and loud did St Keverne call on St Just to stop,
but the latter was deaf to all calls of the kind—on he went,
quickening, however, his pace a little.</p>

<p>At length St Keverne came within a stone’s throw of the
dissembling culprit, and calling him a thief—adding thereto
some of the most choice epithets from his holy vocabulary—taking
a stone from his pocket, he let it fly after St
Just.</p>

<p>The stone falling heavily by the side of St Just convinced
him that he had to deal with an awkward enemy, and that
he had best make all the use he could of his legs. He
quietly untied the chalice, which he had fastened to his
girdle, and let it fall to the ground. Then, still as if unconscious
of his follower, he set off to run as fast as his ponderous
body would allow his legs to carry him. St Keverne
came up to where his cup glistened in the sunshine. He
had recovered his treasure, he should get no good out of
the false friend, and he was sadly jaded with his long run.
Therefore he took, one by one, the stones from his pockets—he
hurled them, fairly aimed, after the retreating culprit,
and cursed him as he went.</p>

<p>There the pebbles remain where they fell,—the peculiarity
of the stone being in all respects unlike anything around,
but being clearly the Crowza stones,—attesting the truth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the legend; and their weights, each one being several hundred
pounds, proving the power of the giant saint.</p>

<p>Many have been the attempts made to remove these
stones. They are carried away easily enough by day, but
they ever return to the spot on which they now repose, at
night.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">THE LONGSTONE. THE GIANT’S HAT AND STAFF.</h3>

<p>Some say it was St Roach, others refer it to St Austell;
but all agree in one thing, that the Longstone was once
the staff of some holy man, and that its present state is
owing to the malignant persecution of the demon of darkness.
It happened after this manner. The good saint who
had been engaged in some mission was returning to his cell
across St Austell Downs. The night had been fine, the
clearness of the sky and the brightness of the stars conduced
to religious thoughts, and those of the saint fled heavenwards.
The devil was wandering abroad that night, and
maliciously he resolved to play a trick upon his enemy.
The saint was wrapt in thought. The devil was working
his dire spells. The sky became black, the stars disappeared,
and suddenly a terrific rush of wind seized the saint,
whirled him round and round, and at last blew his hat high
into the air. The hat went ricocheting over the moor and
the saint after it, the devil enjoying the sport. The long
stick which the saint carried impeded his progress in the
storm, and he stuck it into the ground. On went the hat,
speedily followed the saint over and round the moor, until
thoroughly wearied out, he at length gave up the chase.
He, now exposed to the beat of the tempest bareheaded,
endeavoured to find his way to his cell, and thought to pick
up his staff on the way. No staff could be found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
darkness, and his hat was, he thought, gone irrecoverably.
At length the saint reached his cell, he quieted his spirit by
prayer, and sought the forgetfulness of sleep, safe under the
protection of the holy cross, from all the tricks of the devil.
The evil one, however, was at work on the wild moor, and
by his incantations he changed the hat and the staff into
two rocks. Morning came, the saint went abroad seeking
for his lost covering and support. He found them both—one
a huge circular boulder, and the other a long stone which
remains to this day.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Saint’s, or, as it was often called, the Giant’s Hat was
removed in 1798 by a regiment of soldiers who were encamped
near it. They felt satisfied that this mysterious
stone was the cause of the wet season which rendered their
camp unpleasant, and consequently they resolved to remove
the evil spell by destroying it.</p>

<h3 id="heading4">ST SENNEN AND ST JUST.</h3>

<p>These saints held rule over adjoining parishes; but, like
neighbours, not unfrequently, they quarrelled. We
know not the cause which made their angry passions rise;
but no doubt the saints were occasionally exposed to the influences
of the evil principle, which appears to be one of the
ruling powers of the world. It is not often that we have
instances of excess of passion in man or woman without
some evidence of the evil resulting from it. Every tempest
in the physical world leaves its mark on the face of the
earth. Every tempest in the moral world, in a similar manner,
leaves some scar to tell of its ravages on the soul. A
most enduring monument in granite tells us of the rage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
which those two holy men were the victims. As we have
said, there is no record of the origin of the duel which was
fought between St Just and St Sennen; but, in the fury of
their rage, they tore each a rock from the granite mass, and
hurled it onwards to destroy his brother. They were so
well aimed that both saints must have perished had the
rocks been allowed to travel as intended. A merciful hand
guided them, though in opposite directions, in precisely the
same path. The huge rocks came together; so severe was
the blow of impact that they became one mass, and fell to
the ground, to remain a monument of the impotent rage of
two giants.</p>

<h3 id="heading5">LEGENDS OF ST LEVEN.</h3>

<h3 id="heading6">I.—THE SAINT AND JOHANA.</h3>

<p>The walls of what are supposed to be the hut of St Leven
are still to be seen at Bodellen. If you walk from
Bodellen to St Leven Church, on passing near the stile in
Rospletha you will see a three-cornered garden. This belonged
to a woman who is only known to us as Johana.
Johana’s Garden is still the name of the place. One Sunday
morning St Leven was passing over the stile to go as usual
to his fishing-place below the church, to catch his dinner.
Johana was in the garden picking pot-herbs at the time, and
she lectured the holy man for fishing on a Sunday. They
came to high words, and St Leven told Johana that there
was no more sin in taking his dinner from the sea than she
herself committed in taking hers from the garden. The
saint called her foolish Johana, and said if another of her
name was christened in his well she should be a bigger fool
than Johana herself. From that day to this no child called
Johana has been christened in St Leven. All parents who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
desire to give that name to their daughters, dreading St
Leven’s curse, take the children to Sennen.</p>

<h3 id="heading7">II.—THE SAINT’S PATH.</h3>

<p>The path along which St Leven was accustomed to walk
from Bodellen, by Rospletha, on to St Leven’s Rocks,
as they are still called, may be yet seen; the grass grows
greener wherever the good priest trod than in any other part
of the fields through which the footpath passes.</p>

<h3 id="heading8">III.—THE ST LEVEN STONE.</h3>

<p>On the south side of the church, to the east of the porch,
is a rock known by the above name. It is broken in two,
and the fissure is filled in with ferns and wild flowers,
while the grass grows rank around it. On this rock St
Leven often sat to rest after the fatigue of fishing; and
desiring to leave some enduring memento of himself in connexion
with this his rude but favourite seat, he one day
gave it a blow with his fist and cracked it through. He
prayed over the rock, and uttered the following prophecy:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When, with panniers astride,</div>
<div class="verse">A packhorse one can ride</div>
<div class="verse">Through St Leven’s Stone,</div>
<div class="verse">The world will be done.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This stone must have been venerated for the saint’s sake
when the church was built, or it would certainly have been
employed for the building. It is more than fifty years since
I first made acquaintance, as a child, with the St Leven
Stone, and it may be a satisfaction to many to know that the
progress of separation is an exceedingly slow one. I cannot
detect the slightest difference in the width of the fissure now
and then. At the present slow rate of opening, the packhorse
and panniers will not be able to pass through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
rock for many thousands of years to come. We need not,
therefore, place much reliance on those prophecies which give
but a limited duration to this planet.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading9">IV.—THE TWO BREAMS.</h3>

<p>Although in common with many of the churches in
the remote districts of Cornwall, “decay’s effacing fingers”
have been allowed to do their work in St Leven Church,
yet there still remains some of the ornamental work which
once adorned it. Much of the carving is irremediably gone;
but still the inquirer will find that it once told the story of
important events in the life of the good St Leven. Two
fishes on the same hook form the device, which appears at
one time to have prevailed in this church. These are to
commemorate a remarkable incident in St Leven’s life. One
lovely evening about sunset, St Leven was on his rocks
fishing. There was a heavy pull upon his line, and drawing
it in, he found two breams on the same hook. The good
saint, anxious to serve both alike, to avoid, indeed, even the
appearance of partiality, took both the fishes off the hook,
and cast them back into the sea. Again they came to the
hook, and again were they returned to their native elements.
The line was no sooner cast a third time than the same two
fishes hooked themselves once more. St Leven thought
there must be some reason unknown to him for this strange
occurrence, so he took both the fishes home with him. When
the saint reached Bodellen, he found his sister, St Breage,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
come to visit him with two children. Then he thought he
saw the hand of Providence at work in guiding the fish to
his hook.</p>

<p>Even saints are blind when they attempt to fathom the
ways of the Unseen. The fish were, of course, cooked for
supper; and the saint having asked a blessing upon their
savoury meal, all sat down to partake of it. The children
had walked far, and they were ravenously hungry. They
ate their suppers with rapidity, and, not taking time to pick
out the bones of the fish, they were both choked. The
apparent blessing was thus transformed into a curse, and the
bream has from that day forward ever gone by the name,
amongst fishermen, of “choke children.”</p>

<p>There are many disputes as to the fish concerned in this
legend. Some of the fishermen of St Leven parish have
insisted upon their being “chad,” (the shad, <i>clupeida alosa</i>;)
while others, with the strong evidence afforded by the bony
structure of the fish, will have it to have been the bream,
(<i>cyprinus brama</i>.) My young readers warned by the name,
should be equally careful in eating either of those fish.</p>

<h3 id="heading10">SAINT KEYNE.</h3>

<p>Braghan, or Brechan, was a king in Wales, and the
builder of the town of Brecknock. This worthy old
king and saint was the happy father of twenty-six children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
or, as some say, twenty-four. Of these, fourteen or fifteen
were sainted for their holiness, and their portraits are preserved
within a fold of the kingly robe of the saint, their
father, in the window at St Neot’s Church, bearing the inscription,
“Sante Brechane, cum omnibus sanctis, ora pro
nobis,” and known as the young women’s window.</p>

<p>Of this remarkable family St Keyne stands out as the
brightest star. Lovely beyond measure, she wandered over
the country safe, even in lawless times, from insult, by “the
strength of her purity.”</p>

<p>We find this virtuous woman performing miracles wherever
she went. The district now known by the name of
Keynsham, in Somersetshire, was in those days infested with
serpents. St Keyne, rivaling St Hilda of the Northern Isle,
changed them all into coils of stone, and there they are in
the quarries at the present time to attest the truth of the
legend. Geologists, with more learning than poetry, term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
them Ammonites, deriving their name from the horn of
Jupiter Ammon, as if the Egyptian Jupiter was likely to
have charmed serpents in England. We are satisfied to leave
the question for the consideration of our readers. After a
life spent in the conversion of sinners, the building of
churches, and the performance of miracles, this good woman
retired into Cornwall, and in one of its most picturesque
valleys, she sought and found that quiet which was conducive
to a happy termination of a well-spent life. She desired,
above all things, “peace on earth;” and she hoped to benefit
the world, by giving to woman a chance of being equal to
her lord and master. A beautiful well of water was near
the home of the saint, and she planted, with her blessing, four
trees around it—the withy, the oak, the elm, and the ash.
When the hour of her death was drawing near, St Keyne
caused herself to be borne on a litter to the shade which she
had formed, and soothed by the influence of the murmur of
the flowing fountain, she blessed the waters, and gave them
their wondrous power, thus quaintly described by Carew:—“Next,
I will relate to you, another of the Cornish natural
wonders—viz., St Keyne’s Well; but lest you make wonder,
first at the sainte, before you notice the well, you must understand
that this was not Kayne the Manqueller, but one of a
gentler spirit and milder sex—to wit, a woman. He who
caused the spring to be pictured, added this rhyme for an
explanation:—</p>

<h3 id="heading11">ST DENNIS’S BLOOD.</h3>

<p>The patron saint of the parish church of St Dennis was
born in the city of Athens, in the reign of Tiberius. His
name and fame have full record in the “History of the Saints
of the Church of Rome.” How his name was connected with
this remote parish is not clearly made out. We learn, however,
that the good man was beheaded at Montmartre, and
that he walked after his execution, with his head under his
arm, to the place in Paris which still bears his name. At the
very time when the decapitation took place in Paris, <i>blood
fell on the stones of this churchyard</i> in Cornwall. Previously
to the breaking out of the plague in London, the stains of the
blood of St Dennis were again seen; and during our wars
with the Dutch, the defeat of the English fleet was foretold
by the rain of gore in this remote and sequestered place.
Hals, the Cornish historian, with much gravity, informs us
that he had seen some of the stones with blood upon them.
Whenever this phenomenon occurs again we may expect
some sad calamity to be near.</p>

<p>Some years since a Cornish gentleman was cruelly murdered,
and his body thrown into a brook. I have been very
lately shewn stones taken from this brook with bright red
spots of some vegetable growth on them. It is said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
ever since the murder the stones in this brook are spotted
with gore, whereas they never were so previously to this
dreadful deed.</p>

<h3 id="heading12">ST KEA’S BOAT.</h3>

<p>St Kea, a young Irish saint, stood on the southern shores
of Ireland and saw the Christian missionaries departing
to carry the blessed Word to the heathens of Western England.
He watched their barks fade beneath the horizon,
and he felt that he was left to a solitude which was not fitted
to one in the full energy of young life, and burning with
zeal.</p>

<p>The saint knelt on a boulder of granite lying on the shore,
and he prayed with fervour that Heaven would order it so
that he might diffuse his religious fervour amongst the barbarians
of Cornwall. He prayed on for some time, not
observing the rising of the tide. When he had poured out
his full soul, he awoke to the fact, not only that the waves
were washing around the stone on which he knelt, but that
the stone was actually floating on the water. Impressed
with the miracle, St Kea sprang to his feet, and looking
towards the setting sun, with his cross uplifted, he exclaimed,
“To Thee, and only to Thee, my God, do I trust my soul!”</p>

<p>Onward floated the granite, rendered buoyant by supernatural
power. Floated hither and thither by the tides, it
swam on; blown sometimes in one direction, and sometimes
in another, by the varying winds, days and nights were spent
upon the waters. The faith of St Kea failed not; three
times a day he knelt in prayer to God. At all other times
he stood gazing on the heavens. At length the faith of the
saint being fairly tried, the moorstone boat floated steadily
up the river, and landed at St Kea, which place he soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Christianised, and there stands to this day this monument
of St Kea’s sincere belief.</p>

<h3 id="heading13">ST GERMAN’S WELL.</h3>

<p>The good St German was, it would appear, sent into
Cornwall in the reign of the Emperor Valentinian,
mainly to suppress the Pelagian heresy. The inhabitants of
the shores of the Tamar had long been schooled into the
belief in original sin, and they would not endure its denial
from the lips of a stranger. In this they were supported by
the monks, who had already a firm footing in the land, and
who taught the people implicit obedience to their religious
instructors, faith in election, and that all human efforts were
unavailing, unless supported by priestly aid. St German
was a man with vast powers of endurance. He preached his
doctrines of freewill, and of the value of good works, notwithstanding
the outcry raised against him. His miracles
were of the most remarkable character, and sufficiently impressive
to convince a large body of the Cornish people that
he was an inspired priest. St German raised a beautiful
church, and built a monastic house for the relief of poor
people. Yet notwithstanding the example of the pure life
of the saint, and his unceasing study to do good, a large
section of the priests and the people never ceased to persecute
him. To all human endurance there is a limit, and
even that of the saint weakened eventually, before the never-ceasing
annoyances by which he was hemmed in.</p>

<p>One Sabbath morning the priest attended as usual to his
Christian duties, when he was interrupted by a brawl amongst
the outrageous people, who had come in from all parts of the
country with a determination to drive him from the place of
his adoption. The holy man prayed for his persecutors, and
he entreated them to calm their angry passions and listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to his healing words. But no words could convey any healing
balm to their stormy hearts. At length his brethren,
fearing that his life was in danger, begged him to fly, and
eventually he left the church by a small door near the altar,
while some of the monks endeavoured to tranquillise the
people. St German went, a sad man, to the cliffs at the
Rame head, and there alone he wept in agony at the failure
of his labours. So intense was the soul-suffering of this
holy man, that the rocks felt the power of spirit-struggling,
and wept with him. The eyes of man, a spiritual creation,
dry after the outburst of sorrow, but when the gross forms
of matter are compelled to sympathise with spiritual sorrow,
they remain for ever under the influence; and from that
day the tears of the cliffs have continued to fall, and the Well
of St German attests to this day of the saint’s agony. The
saint was not allowed to remain in concealment long. The
crowd of opposing priests and the peasantry were on his
track. Hundreds were on the hill, and arming themselves
with stones, they descended with shouts, determined to
destroy him. St German prayed to God for deliverance,
and immediately a rush, as of thunder, was heard upon
the hills—a chariot surrounded by flames, and flashing
light in all directions, was seen rapidly approaching. The
crowd paused, fell back, and the flaming car passed on to
where St German knelt. There were two bright angels in
the chariot; they lifted the persecuted saint from the ground,
and placing him between them, ascended into the air.</p>

<p>“Curse your persecutors,” said the angels. The saint
cursed them; and from that time all holiness left the church
he had built. The saint was borne to other lands, and lived
to effect great good. On the rocks the burnt tracks of the
chariot wheels were long to be seen, and the Well of Tears
still flows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading14">HOW ST PIRAN REACHED CORNWALL.</h3>

<p>Good men are frequently persecuted by those whom they
have benefited the most. The righteous Piran had, by
virtue of his sanctity, been enabled to feed ten Irish kings
and their armies for ten days together with three cows. He
brought to life by his prayers the dogs which had been killed
while hunting the elk and the boar, and even restored to
existence many of the warriors who had fallen on the battlefield.
Notwithstanding this, and his incomparable goodness,
some of these kings condemned him to be cast off a precipice
into the sea, with a millstone around his neck.</p>

<p>On a boisterous day, a crowd of the lawless Irish assembled
on the brow of a beetling cliff, with Piran in chains. By great
labour they had rolled a huge millstone to the top of the hill,
and Piran was chained to it. At a signal from one of the
kings, the stone and the saint were rolled to the edge of, and
suddenly over, the cliff into the Atlantic. The winds were
blowing tempestuously, the heavens were dark with clouds,
and the waves white with crested foam. No sooner was
Piran and the millstone launched into space, than the sun
shone out brightly, casting the full lustre of its beams on
the holy man, who sat tranquilly on the descending stone.
The winds died away, and the waves became smooth as a
mirror. The moment the millstone touched the water, hundreds
were converted to Christianity who saw this miracle.
St Piran floated on safely to Cornwall; he landed on the
5th of March on the sands which bear his name. He lived
amongst the Cornish men until he attained the age of 206
years.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading15">ST PERRAN, THE MINERS’ SAINT.</h3>

<p>St Piran, or St Perran, has sometimes gained the
credit of discovering tin in Cornwall; yet Usher places
the date of his birth about the year 352; and the merchants
of Tyre are said to have traded with Cornwall for tin as
early as the days of King Solomon.</p>

<p>There are three places in Cornwall to which the name of
Perran is given:—</p>

<p>Perran-Aworthall—<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Perran on the noted River</i>.</p>

<p>Perran-Uthno—<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Perran the Little</i>.</p>

<p>Perran-Zabuloe—<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Perran in the Sands</i>.</p>

<p>This sufficiently proves that the saint, or some one bearing
that name, was eminently popular amongst the people;
and in St Perran we have an example—of which several
instances are given—of the manner in which a very ancient
event is shifted forward, as it were, for the purpose of investing
some popular hero with additional reasons for securing
the devotion of the people, and of drawing them to his
shrine.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Picrous, or Piecras, is another name which has been
floated by tradition, down the stream of time, in connexion
with the discovery of tin; and in the eastern portion of
Cornwall, Picrous-day, the second Thursday before Christmas-day,
is kept as the tinners’ holiday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The popular story of the discovery of tin is, however,
given, with all its anachronisms.</p>

<h3 id="heading16">THE DISCOVERY OF TIN.</h3>

<p>St Piran, or St Perran, leading his lonely life on the
plains which now bear his name, devoted himself to the
study of the objects which presented themselves to his notice.
The good saint decorated the altar in his church with
the choicest flowers, and his cell was adorned with the crystals
which he could collect from the neighbouring rocks. In
his wanderings on the sea-shore, St Perran could not but
observe the numerous mineral veins running through the
slate rocks forming the beautiful cliffs on this coast. Examples
of every kind he collected; and on one occasion,
when preparing his humble meal, a heavy black stone was
employed to form a part of the fireplace. The fire was
more intense than usual, and a stream of beautiful white
metal flowed out of the fire. Great was the joy of the saint;
he perceived that God, in His goodness, had discovered to
him something which would be useful to man. St Perran
communicated his discovery to St Chiwidden. They examined
the shores together, and Chiwidden, who was learned
in the learning of the East, soon devised a process for producing
this metal in large quantities. The two saints
called the Cornish men together. They told them of their
treasures, and they taught them how to dig the ore from
the earth, and how, by the agency of fire, to obtain the
metal. Great was the joy in Cornwall, and many days of
feasting followed the announcement. Mead and metheglin,
with other drinks, flowed in abundance; and vile rumour
says the saints and their people were rendered equally unstable
thereby. “Drunk as a Perraner,” has certainly passed
into a proverb from that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The riot of joy at length came to an end, and steadily,
seriously, the tribes of Perran and St Agnes set to work.
They soon accumulated a vast quantity of this precious
metal; and when they carried it to the southern coasts, the
merchants from Gaul eagerly purchased it of them. The
noise of the discovery, even in those days, rapidly extended
itself; and even the cities of Tyre learned that a metal precious
to them, was to be obtained in a country far to the
west. The Phœnician navigators were not long in finding
out the Tin Islands; and great was the alarm amidst the
Cornish Britons lest the source of their treasure should be
discovered. Then it was they intrenched the whole of St
Agnes beacon; then it was they built the numerous hill
castles, which have puzzled the antiquarian; then it was
that they constructed the Rounds,—amongst which the Perran
Round remains as a remarkable example,—all of them to
protect their tin ground. So resolved were the whole of the
population of the district to preserve the tin workings, that
they prevented any foreigner from landing on the mainland,
and they established tin markets on the islands on the coast.
On these islands were hoisted the standard of Cornwall, a
white cross on a black ground, which was the device of St
Perran and St Chiwidden, symbolising the black tin ore and
the white metal.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading17">ST NEOT, THE PIGMY.</h3>

<p>Whence came the saint, or hermit, who has given his
name to two churches in England, is not known.</p>

<p>Tradition, however, informs us that he was remarkably
small in stature, though exquisitely formed. He could not,
according to all accounts, have been more than fifteen inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
high. Yet, though so diminutive a man, he possessed a soul
which was giant-like in the power of his faith. The
Church of St Neot, which has been built on the ancient site
of the hermit’s cell, is situated in a secluded valley, watered
by a branch of the river Fowey. The surrounding country
is, even now, but very partially cultivated, and it must have
been, a few centuries since, a desert waste; but the valley
is, and no doubt ever has been, beautifully wooded. Not
far from the church is the holy well, in which the pious
anchorite would stand immersed to his neck, whilst he repeated
the whole Book of Psalms. Great was the reward
for such an exercise of devotion and faith. Out of numerous
miracles we select only a few, which have some especial
character about them.</p>

<h3 id="heading18">ST NEOT AND THE FOX.</h3>

<p>One day the holy hermit was standing in his bath chanting
the Psalms, when he heard the sound of huntsmen approaching.
Whether the saint feared ridicule or ill-treatment, we
know not; but certainly he left some psalms unsung that
day, and hastily gathering up his clothes, he fled to his cell.</p>

<p>In his haste the goodman lost his shoe, and a hungry fox
having escaped the hunters, came to the spring to drink.
Having quenched the fever of thirst, and being hungry, he
spied the saint’s shoe, and presently ate it. The hermit
despatched his servant to look for his shoe; and, lo, he
found the fox cast into a deep sleep, and the thongs of the
shoe hanging out of his vile mouth. Of course the shoe was
pulled out of his stomach, and restored to the saint.</p>

<h3 id="heading19">ST NEOT AND THE DOE.</h3>

<p>Again, on another day, when the hermit was in his fountain,
a lovely doe, flying from the huntsmen, fell down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
on the edge of the well, imploring, with tearful eyes and
anxious pantings, the aid of St Neot. The dogs followed in
full chase, ready to pounce on the trembling doe, and eager
to tear her in pieces. They saw the saint, and one look from
his holy eyes sent them flying back into the woods, more
speedily, if possible, than they rushed out of it.</p>

<p>The huntsman too came on, ready to discharge his arrow
into the heart of the doe; but, impressed with the sight he
saw, he fell on his knees, cast away his quiver, and became
from that day a follower of the saint’s, giving him his horn
to hang, as a memorial, in the church, where it was long to
be seen. The huntsman became eventually one of the monks
of the neighbouring house of St Petroch.</p>

<h3 id="heading20">ST NEOT AND THE THIEVES.</h3>

<p>When St Neot was abbot, some thieves came by night and
stole the oxen belonging to the farm of the monastery. The
weather was most uncertain,—the seed-time was passing
away,—and a fine morning rendered it imperative that the
ploughs should be quickly employed. There were no oxen.
Great was the difficulty, and earnest were the abbot’s prayers.
In answer to them, the wild stags came in from the forests,
and tamely offered their necks to the yoke. When unyoked
in the evening, they resorted to their favourite pastures, but
voluntarily returned each morning to their work. The report
of this event reached the ears of the thieves. They
became penitent, and restored the oxen to the monastery.
Not only so, but they consecrated their days to devotional
exercises. The oxen being restored, the stags were dismissed;
but they bore for ever a white ring, like a yoke,
about their necks, and they held a charmed life, safe
from the shafts of the hunters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading21">ST NEOT AND THE FISHES.</h3>

<p>On one occasion, when the saint was at his devotions, an
angel appeared unto him, and shewing him three fishes in
the well, he said, “These are for thee; take one each day
for thy daily food, and the number shall never grow less:
the choice of one of three fishes shall be thine all the days of
thy life.” Long time passed by, and daily a fish was taken
from the well, and three awaited his coming every morning.
At length the saint, who shared in human suffering notwithstanding
his piety, fell ill; and being confined to his bed, St
Neot sent his servant Barius to fetch him a fish for his dinner.
Barius being desirous of pleasing, if possible, the sick
man’s taste, went to the well and caught two fishes. One of
these he broiled, and the other he boiled. Nicely cooked,
Barius took them on a dish to his master’s bedside, who
started up alarmed for the consequences of the act of his
servant, in disobedience to the injunctions of the angel.
So good a man could not allow wrath to get the mastery of
him; so he sat up in his bed, and, instead of eating, he
prayed with great earnestness over the cooked fish. At last
the spirit of holiness exerted its full power. St Neot commanded
Barius to return at once and cast the fish into the
well. Barius went and did as his master had told him to
do; and, lo, the moment the fishes fell into the water they
recovered life, and swam away with the third fish, as if
nothing had happened to them.</p>

<p>All these things and more are recorded in the windows of
St Neot’s Church.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading22">PROBUS AND GRACE.</h3>

<p>Every one is acquainted with the beautiful tower of
Probus Church. If they are not, they should lose no
time in visiting it. Various are the stories in connexion
with those two saints, who are curiously connected with the
church, and one of the fairs held in the church-town. A
safe tradition tells us that St Probus built the church, and
failing in the means of adding a tower to his building, he
petitioned St Grace to aid him. Grace was a wealthy lady,
and she resolved at her own cost to build a tower, the like of
which should not be seen in the “West Countrie.” Regardless
of the expense, sculptured stone was worked by the most
skilful masons, and the whole put together in the happiest
of proportions. When the tower was finished, St Probus
opened his church with every becoming solemnity, and took
to himself all the praise which was lavished on the tower,
although he had built only a plain church. When, however,
the praise of Probus was at the highest, a voice was
heard slowly and distinctly exclaiming,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Saint Probus and Grace,</div>
<div class="verse">Not the first, but the last;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and thus for ever have Probus and Grace been united as
patron saints of this church.</p>

<p>Mr Davies Gilbert remarks, however, in his “Parochial
History:” “Few gentlemen’s houses in the west of Cornwall
were without the honour of receiving Prince Charles
during his residence in the county about the middle part of
the civil wars; and he is said to have remained for a time
longer than usual with Mr Williams, who, after the Restoration,
waited on the king with congratulations from the
parish; and, on being complimented by him with the question
whether he could do anything for his friends, answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that the parish would esteem themselves highly honoured
and distinguished by the grant of a fair, which was accordingly
done for the 17th September. This fair coming the
last in succession after three others, has acquired for itself a
curious appellation, derived from the two patron saints, and
from the peculiar pronunciation in that neighbourhood of
the word last, somewhat like laest,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Saint Probus and Grace,</div>
<div class="verse">Not the first, but the last,’—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and from this distinction it is usually called Probus and
Grace Fair.” We are obliged, therefore, to lean on the
original tradition for the true meaning of this couplet.</p>

<h3 id="heading23">ST NECTAN’S KIEVE AND THE LONELY SISTERS.</h3>

<p>Far up the deep and rocky vale of Trevillet, in the parish
of Tintagel,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> stands on a pile of rocks the little chapel
of the good St Nectan. No holy man ever selected a more
secluded, or a more lovely spot in which to pass a religious
life. From the chapel rock you look over the deep valley
full of trees. You see here and there the lovely trout-stream,
running rapidly towards the sea; and, opening in the
distance, there rolls the mighty ocean itself. Although this
oratory is shut in amongst the woods, so as to be invisible
to any one approaching it by land, until they are close upon
it, it is plainly seen by the fishermen or by the sailor far off
at sea; and in olden time the prayers of St Nectan were
sought by all whose business was in the “deep waters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The river runs steadily along within a short distance of St
Nectan’s Chapel, and then it suddenly leaps over the rock—a
beautiful fall of water—into St Nectan’s Kieve. This deep
rock-basin, brimming with the clearest water, overflows, and
another waterfall carries the river to the lower level of the
valley. Standing here within a circular wall of rocks, you see
how the falling fluid has worked back the softer slate-rock
until it has reached the harder masses, which are beautifully
polished by the same agent. Mosses, ferns, and grasses decorate
the fall, fringing every rock with a native drapery of
the most exquisite beauty. Here is one of the wildest, one
of the most untrained, and, at the same time, one of the
most beautiful spots in Cornwall, full of poetry, and coloured
by legend. Yet here comes prosaic man, and by one stroke
of his everyday genius, he adds, indeed, a colour to the
violet. You walk along the valley, through paths trodden
out of the undergrowth, deviously wandering up hill, or
down hill, as rock or tree has interposed. Many a spot of
quiet beauty solicits you to loiter, and loitering, you feel that
there are places from which the winds appear to gather
poetry. You break the spell, or the ear, catching the
murmur of the waters, dispels the illusions which have been
created by the eye, and you wander forward anxious to reach
the holy “Kieve,”—to visit the saint’s hermitage. Here, say
you, is the place to hold “commune with Nature’s works,
and view her charms unrolled,” when, lo, a well-made door
painted lead colour, with a real substantial lock, bars your
way, and Fancy, with everything that is holy, flies away before
the terrible words which inform you that trespassers will be
punished, and that the key can be obtained at ——. Well
was it that Mr Wilkie Collins gave “up the attempt to
discover Nighton’s Kieve;”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> for had he, when he had found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
it, discovered this evidence of man’s greedy soul, it would
have convinced him that the “evil genius of fairy mythology,”
who so cautiously hid “the nymph of the waterfall,”
was no other than the farmer, who, as he told me, “owns the
fee,” and one who is resolved also, to pocket the fee, before
any pilgrim can see the oratory and the waterfall of St
Nectan. Of course this would have turned the placid
current of the thoughts of “the Rambler beyond Railways,”
which now flow so pleasantly, into a troubled stream of
biliary bitterness.</p>

<p>St Nectan placed in the little bell-tower of his secluded
chapel a silver bell, the notes of which were so clear and
penetrating that they could be heard far off at sea. When
the notes came through the air, and fell on the ears of the
seamen, they knew that St Nectan was about to pray for
them, and they prostrated themselves before Heaven for a
few minutes, and thus endeavoured to win the blessing.</p>

<p>St Nectan was on the bed of death. There was strife in the
land. A severe struggle was going on between the Churchmen,
and endeavours were being made to introduce a new faith.</p>

<p>The sunset of life gave to the saint the spirit of prophecy,
and he told his weeping followers that the light of their
religion would grow dim in the land; but that a spark would
for ever live amidst the ashes, and that in due time it would
kindle into a flame, and burn more brightly than ever. His
silver bell, he said, should never ring for others than the true
believer. He would enclose it in the rock of the Kieve;
but when again the true faith revived, it should be recovered,
and rung, to cheer once more the land.</p>

<p>One lovely summer evening, while the sun was slowly sinking
towards the golden sea, St Nectan desired his attendants
to carry him to the bank which overhung the “Kieve,” and requested
them to take the bell from the tower and bring it to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>There he lay for some time in silent prayer, waiting as if for
a sign, then slowly raising himself from the bed on which he
had been placed, he grasped the silver bell. He rang it
sharply and clearly three times, and then he dropped it into
the transparent waters of the Kieve. He watched it disappear,
and then he closed his eyes in death. On receiving
the bell the waters were troubled, but they soon became clear
as before, and the bell was nowhere to be seen. St Nectan
died, and two strange ladies from a foreign land came and
took possession of his oratory, and all that belonged unto
the holy man. They placed—acting, as it was believed, on
the wishes of the saint himself—his body, all the sacramental
plate, and other sacred treasures, in a large oak chest. They
turned the waters of the fall aside, and dug a grave in the
river bed, below the Kieve, in which they placed this precious
chest. The waters were then returned to their natural course,
and they murmur ever above the grave of him who loved
them. The silver bell was concealed in the Kieve, and the
saint with all that belonged to his holy office rested beneath
the river bed. The oratory was dismantled, and the two
ladies, women evidently of high birth, chose it for their
dwelling. Their seclusion was perfect. “Both appeared to
be about the same age, and both were inflexibly taciturn.
One was never seen without the other. If they ever left the
house, they only left it to walk in the more unfrequented
parts of the wood; they kept no servant; they never had a
visitor; no living soul but themselves ever crossed the door
of their cottage.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The berries of the wood, a few roots
which they cultivated, with snails gathered from the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and walls, and fish caught in the stream, served them for
food. Curiosity was excited, the mystery which hung
around this solitary pair became deepened by the obstinate
silence which they observed in everything relating to themselves.
The result of all this was an anxious endeavour, on
the part of the superstitious and ignorant peasantry, to learn
their secret. All was now conjecture, and the imagination
commonly enough filled in a wild picture: devils or
angels, as the case might be, were seen ministering to the
solitary ones. Prying eyes were upon them, but the spies
could glean no knowledge. Week, month, year passed by,
and ungratified curiosity was dying through want of food,
when it was discovered that one of the ladies had died.
The peasantry went in a body to the chapel; no one forbade
their entering it now. There sat a silent mourner leaning
over the placid face of her dead sister. Hers was, indeed, a
silent sorrow—no tear was in her eye, no sigh hove her
chest, but the face told all that a remediless woe had fallen
on her heart. The dead body was eventually removed, the
living sister making no sign, and they left her in her solitude
alone. Days passed on; no one heard of, no one probably
inquired after, the lonely one. At last a wandering child,
curious as children are, clambered to the window of the cell
and looked in. There sat the lady; her handkerchief was on
the floor, and one hand hung strangely, as if endeavouring
to pick it up, but powerless to do so. The child told its
story—the people again flocked to the chapel, and they found
one sister had followed the other. The people buried the
last beside the first, and they left no mark to tell us where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
unless the large flat stone which lies in the valley, a short
distance from the foot of the fall, and beneath which, I was
told, “some great person was buried,” may be the covering
of their tomb. No traces of the history of these solitary
women have ever been discovered.</p>

<p>Centuries have passed away, and still the legends of the
buried bell and treasure are preserved. Some long time
since a party of men resolved to blast the “Kieve,” and examine
it for the silver bell. They were miners, and their
engineering knowledge, though rude, was sufficient to enable
them to divert the course of the river above the falls, and
thus to leave the “Kieve” dry for them to work on when
they had emptied it, which was an easy task. The “borer”
now rung upon the rock, holes were pierced, and, being
charged, they were blasted. The result was, however, anything
but satisfactory, for the rock remained intact. Still
they persevered, until at length a voice was heard amidst the
ring of the iron tools in the holes of the rock. Every hand
was stayed, every face was aghast, as they heard distinctly
the ring of the silver bell, followed by a clear solemn voice
proclaiming, “The child is not yet born who shall recover
this treasure.”</p>

<p>The work was stopped, and the river restored to its old
channel, over which it will run undisturbed until the day of
which St Nectan prophesied shall arrive.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When, in the autumn of 1863, I visited this lovely spot, my guide, the
proprietor, informed me that very recently a gentleman residing, I believe,
in London, dreamed that an angel stood on a little bank of pebbles, forming
a petty island, at the foot of a waterfall, and, pointing to a certain spot,
told him to search there and he would find gold and a mummy. This
gentleman told his dream to a friend, who at once declared the place indicated
to be St Nectan’s waterfall. Upon this, the dreamer visited the
West, and, upon being led by the owner of the property to the fall, he at
once recognised the spot on which the angel stood.</p>

<p>A plan was then and there arranged by which a search might be again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
commenced, it being thought that, as an angel had indicated the spot, the
time for the recovery of the treasure had arrived.</p>

<p>Let us hope that the search may be deferred, lest the natural beauties
of the spot should be destroyed by the meddling of men, who can threaten
trespassers,—fearing to lose a sixpence,—and who have already endeavoured
to improve on nature, by cutting down some of the rock and planting
rhododendrons.</p>

<p>The Rev. R. S. Hawker, of Morwenstow, has published in his “Echoes of
Old Cornwall” a poem on this tradition, which, as it is but little known,
and as it has the true poetic ring, I transcribe to adorn the pages of my
Appendix.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading24">THEODORE, KING OF CORNWALL.</h3>

<p>Riviere, near Hayle, now called Rovier, was the palace
of Theodore, the king, to whom Cornwall appears to
have been indebted for many of its saints. This Christian
king, when the pagan people sought to destroy the first missionaries,
gave the saints shelter in his palace. St Breca,
St Iva, St Burianna, and many others, are said to have made
Riviere their residence. It is not a little curious to find
traditions existing, as it were, in a state of suspension between
opinions. I have heard it said that there was a
church at Rovier—that there was once a great palace there;
and again, that Castle Cayle was one vast fortified place, and
Rovier another. Mr Davies Gilbert quotes Whitaker on
this point:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr Whitaker, who captivates every reader by the brilliancy of his
style, and astonishes by the extent of his multifarious reading, draws,
however, without reserve, on his fertile imagination, for whatever facts
may be requisite to construct the fabric of a theory. He has made Riviere
the palace and residence of Theodore, a sovereign prince of Cornwall, and
conducts St Breca, St Iva, with several companions, not only into Hayle
and to this palace, after their voyage from Ireland, but fixes the time of
their arrival so exactly, as to make it take place in the night. In recent
times the name of Riviere, which had been lost in the common pronunciation,
Rovier, has revived in a very excellent house built by Mr Edwards
on the farm, which he completed in 1791.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p class="dropcap">A spring of water has always something about
it which gives rise to holy feelings. From the
dark earth there wells up a pellucid fluid, which
in its apparent tranquil joyousness gives gladness
to all around. The velvet mosses, the sword-like
grasses, and the feathery ferns, grow with more of that light
and vigorous nature which indicates a fulness of life, within
the charmed influence of a spring of water, than they do
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The purity of the fluid impresses itself, through the eye,
upon the mind, and its power of removing all impurity is
felt to the soul. “Wash and be clean,” is the murmuring
call of the waters, as they overflow their rocky basins, or
grassy vases, and deeply sunk in depravity must that man
be who could put to unholy uses one of nature’s fountains.
The inner life of a well of waters, bursting from its grave in
the earth, may be religiously said to form a type of the soul
purified by death, rising into a glorified existence and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fulness of light. The tranquil beauty of the rising waters,
whispering the softest music, like the healthful breathing of
a sleeping infant, sends a feeling of happiness through the
soul of the thoughtful observer, and the inner man is purified
by its influence, as the outer man is cleansed by ablution.</p>

<p>Water cannot be regarded as having an inanimate existence.
Its all-pervading character and its active nature,
flowing on for ever, resting never, removes it from the torpid
elements, and places it, like the air, amongst those higher
creations which belong to the vital powers of the earth.
The spring of water rises from the cold dark earth, it runs,
a silver cord glistening in the sunshine, down the mountainside.
The rill (prettily called by Drayton “a rillet”) gathers
rejoicingly other waters unto itself, and it grows into a
<i>brooklet</i> in its course. At length, flowing onward and increasing
in size, the <i>brook</i> state of being is fairly won; and
then, by the gathering together of some more dewdrops, the
full dignity of a stream is acquired. Onwards the waters
flow, still gleaning from every side, and wooing new <i>runlets</i>
to its bosom, eager as it were to assume the state which,
in America, would be called a “run” of water. Stream
gathers on stream, and run on run; the union of waters
becomes a <i>river</i>; rolling in its maturity, swelling in its pride,
it seeks the ocean, and there is absorbed in the eternity of
waters. Has ever poet yet penned a line which in any way
conveys to the mind a sense of the grandeur, the immensity
of the sea? I do not remember a verse which does not
prove the incapacity of the human mind to embrace in its
vastness the gathering together of the waters in the mighty
sea. Man’s mind is tempered, and his pride subdued, as he
stands on the sea-side and looks on the undulating expanse
to which, to him, there is no end. A material eternity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
rain-drops gathered into a mass which is from Omnipotence
and is omnipotent. The influences of heaven falling on the
sheeted waters, they rise at their bidding and float in air,
making the skies more beautiful or more sublime, according
to the spirit of the hour. Whether the clouds float over the
earth, illumined by sun-rays, like the cars of loving angels;
or rush wildly onward, as if bearing demons of vengeance,
they are subdued by the mountains, and fall reluctantly as
mists around the rocks, condense solemnly as dews upon the
sleeping flowers, sink to earth resignedly as tranquil rains,
or splash in tempestuous anger on its surface. The draught,
in whatever form it comes, is drunk with avidity, and, circulating
through the subterranean recesses of the globe, it does
its work of re-creation, and eventually reappears a bubbling
spring, again to run its round of wonder-working tasks.</p>

<p>Those minds which saw a God in light, and worshipped a
Creator in the sun, felt the power of the universal solvent,
and saw in the diffusive nature of that fluid which is everywhere,
something more than a type of the regenerating
Spirit, which all, in their holier hours, feel necessary to clear
off the earthiness of life. Man has ever sought to discover
the spiritual in the material, and, from the imperfections of
human reason, he has too frequently reposed on the material,
and given to it the attributes which are purely spiritual.
Through all ages the fountains of the hills and valleys have
claimed the reverence of men; and waters presenting themselves,
under aspects of beauty, or of terror, have been regarded
with religious feelings of hope or of awe.</p>

<p>As it was of old, so is it to-day. It was but yesterday
that I stood near the font of Royston Church, and heard
the minister read with emphasis, “None can enter into the
kingdom of God except he be regenerate and born anew of
water.” Surely the simple faith of the peasant mother who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
on a spring morning, takes her weakly infant to some holy
well, and three times dipping it in its clear waters, uttering
an earnest prayer at each immersion, is but another form of
the prescribed faith of the educated churchman.</p>

<p>Surely the practice of consulting the waters of a sacred
spring, by young men and maidens, is but a traditional
faith derived from the early creeds of Greece—a continuance
of the <i>Hydromancy</i> which sought in the Castalian
fountain the divination of the future.</p>

<h3 id="heading26">THE WELL OF ST CONSTANTINE.</h3>

<p>In the parish of St Merran, or Meryn, near Padstow, are
the remains of the Church of St Constantine, and the
holy well of that saint. It had been an unusually hot and
dry summer, and all the crops were perishing through want
of water. The people inhabiting the parish had grown irreligious,
and many of them sadly profane. The drought was
a curse upon them for their wickedness. Their church was
falling into ruin, their well was foul, and the arches over it
were decayed and broken. In their distress, the wicked
people who had reviled the Word of God, went to their
priest for aid.</p>

<p>“There is no help for thee, unless thou cleansest the holy
well.”</p>

<p>They laughed him to scorn.</p>

<p>The drought continued, and they suffered want.</p>

<p>To the priest they went again.</p>

<p>“Cleanse the well,” was his command, “and see the power
of the blessing of the first Christian emperor.” That cleansing
a dirty well should bring them rain they did not believe.
The drought continued, the rivers were dry, the people suffered
thirst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cleanse the well—wash, and drink,” said the priest, when
they again went to him.</p>

<p>Hunger and thirst made the people obedient. They went
to the task. Mosses and weeds were removed, and the filth
cleansed. To the surprise of all, beautifully clear water welled
forth. They drank the water and prayed, and then washed
themselves, and were refreshed. As they bathed their bodies,
parched with heat, in the cool stream which flowed from the
well, the heavens clouded over, and presently rain fell, turning
all hearts to the true faith.</p>

<h3 id="heading27">THE WELL OF ST LUDGVAN.</h3>

<p>St Ludgvan, an Irish missionary, had finished his work.
On the hill-top, looking over the most beautiful of
bays, the church stood with all its blessings. Yet the saint,
knowing human nature, determined on associating with it
some object of a miraculous character, which should draw
people from all parts of the world to Ludgvan. The saint
prayed over the dry earth, which was beneath him, as he
knelt on the church stile. His prayer was for water, and
presently a most beautiful crystal stream welled up from
below. The holy man prayed on, and then, to try the virtues
of the water, he washed his eyes. They were rendered
at once more powerful, so penetrating, indeed, as to enable
him to see microscopic objects. The saint prayed again, and
then he drank of the water. He discovered that his powers
of utterance were greatly improved, his tongue formed words
with scarcely any effort of his will. The saint now prayed,
that all children baptized in the waters of this well might
be protected against the hangman and his hempen cord; and
an angel from heaven came down into the water, and promised
the saint that his prayers should be granted. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
long after this, a good farmer and his wife brought their
babe to the saint, that it might derive all the blessings belonging
to this holy well. The priest stood at the baptismal
font, the parents, with their friends around. The saint proceeded
with the baptismal ceremonial, and at length the
time arrived when he took the tender babe into his holy
arms. He signed the sign of the cross over the child, and
when he sprinkled water on the face of the infant its face
glowed with a divine intelligence. The priest then proceeded
with the prayer; but, to the astonishment of all, whenever
he used the name of Jesus, the child, who had received the
miraculous power of speech, from the water, pronounced distinctly
the name of the devil, much to the consternation of
all present. The saint knew that an evil spirit had taken
possession of the child, and he endeavoured to cast him out;
but the devil proved stronger than the saint for some time.
St Ludgvan was not to be beaten; he knew that the spirit
was a restless soul, which had been exorcised from Treassow,
and he exerted all his energies in prayer. At length the
spirit became obedient, and left the child. He was now
commanded by the saint to take his flight to the Red Sea.
He rose, before the terrified spectators, into a gigantic size,
he then spat into the well; he laid hold of the pinnacles of
the tower, and shook the church until they thought it would
fall. The saint was alone unmoved. He prayed on, until,
like a flash of lightning, the demon vanished, shaking down
a pinnacle in his flight. The demon, by spitting in the water
destroyed the spells of the water upon the eyes<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the
tongue too; but it fortunately retains its virtue of preventing
any child baptized in it from being hanged with a cord
of hemp. Upon a cord of silk it is stated to have no power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>This well had nearly lost its reputation once—a Ludgvan
woman was hanged, under the circumstances told in the following
narrative:—</p>

<p>A small farmer, living in one of the most western districts
of the county, died some years back of what was supposed at
that time to be “English cholera.” A few weeks after his
decease his wife married again. This circumstance excited
some attention in the neighbourhood. It was remembered
that the woman had lived on very bad terms with her late husband,
that she had on many occasions exhibited strong symptoms
of possessing a very vindictive temper, and that during
the farmer’s lifetime she had openly manifested rather more
than a Platonic preference for the man whom she subsequently
married. Suspicion was generally excited; people began to
doubt whether the first husband had died fairly. At length
the proper order was applied for, and his body was disinterred.
On examination, enough arsenic to have poisoned three men
was found in the stomach. The wife was accused of murdering
her husband, was tried, convicted on the clearest evidence,
and hanged. Very shortly after she had suffered capital punishment
horrible stories of a ghost were widely circulated.
Certain people declared that they had seen a ghastly resemblance
of the murderess, robed in her winding-sheet, with
the black mark of the rope round her swollen neck, standing
on stormy nights upon her husband’s grave, and digging
there with a spade, in hideous imitation of the actions of the
men who had disinterred the corpse for medical examination.
This was fearful enough; nobody dared go near the place
after nightfall. But soon another circumstance was talked
of in connexion with the poisoner, which affected the tranquillity
of people’s minds in the village where she had
lived, and where it was believed she had been born, more
seriously than even the ghost story itself. The well of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
St Ludgvan, celebrated among the peasantry of the district
for its one remarkable property, that every child baptized
in its water (with which the church was duly supplied
on christening occasions) was secure from ever being
hanged.</p>

<p>No one doubted that all the babies fortunate enough to
be born and baptized in the parish, though they might live
to the age of Methuselah, and might during that period
commit all the capital crimes recorded in the “Newgate
Calendar,” were still destined to keep quite clear of the summary
jurisdiction of Jack Ketch. No one doubted this
until the story of the apparition of the murderess began to
be spread abroad, then awful misgivings arose in the popular
mind.</p>

<p>A woman who had been born close by the magical well,
and who had therefore in all probability been baptized in its
water, like her neighbours of the parish, had nevertheless
been publicly and unquestionably hanged. However, probability
is not always the truth. Every parishioner determined
that the baptismal register of the poisoner should be sought
for, and that it should be thus officially ascertained whether
she had been christened with the well water or not. After
much trouble, the important document was discovered—not
where it was at first looked after, but in a neighbouring
parish. A mistake had been made about the woman’s birthplace;
she had not been baptized in St Ludgvan church, and
had therefore not been protected by the marvellous virtue of
the local water. Unutterable was the joy and triumph of
this discovery. The wonderful character of the parish well
was wonderfully vindicated; its celebrity immediately spread
wider than ever. The peasantry of the neighbouring districts
began to send for the renowned water before christenings;
and many of them actually continue, to this day, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
bring it corked up in bottles to their churches, and to beg
particularly that it may be used whenever they present their
children to be baptized.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading28">GULVAL WELL.</h3>

<p>A young woman, with a child in her arms, stands by the
side of Gulval Well, in Fosses Moor. There is an expression
of extreme anxiety in her interesting face, which
exhibits a considerable amount of intelligence. She appears
to doubt, and yet be disposed to believe in, the virtues of this
remarkable well. She pauses, looks at her babe, and sighs.
She is longing to know something of the absent, but she
fears the well may indicate the extreme of human sorrow.
While she is hesitating, an old woman advances towards her,
upon whom the weight of eighty years was pressing, but not
over heavily; and she at once asked the young mother if
she wished to ask the well after the health of her husband.</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Alcie,” she replied; “I am so anxious. I
have not heard of John for six long months. I could
not sleep last night, so I rose with the light, and came
here, determined to ask the well; but I am afraid. O Aunt
Alcie, suppose the well should not speak, I should die on the
spot!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, cheeld,” said the old woman; “thy man is
well enough; and the well will boil, if thee’lt ask it in a
proper spirit.”</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Alcie, if it sends up puddled water, or if it
remains quiet, what would become of me?”</p>

<p>“Never be foreboding, cheeld; troubles come quick without
running to meet ’em. Take my word for it, the fayther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of thy little un will soon be home again. Ask the well!
ask the well!”</p>

<p>“Has it told any death or sickness lately?” asked the
young mother.</p>

<p>“On St Peter’s eve Mary Curnew questioned the water
about poor Willy.”</p>

<p>“And the water never moved?”</p>

<p>“The well was quiet; and verily I guess it was about that
time he died.”</p>

<p>“Any sickness, Aunt Alcie?”</p>

<p>“Jenny Kelinach was told, by a burst of mud, how ill her
old mother was; but do not be feard, all is well with Johnny
Thomas.”</p>

<p>Still the woman hesitated; desire, fear, hope, doubt, superstition,
and intelligence struggled within her heart and brain.</p>

<p>The old creature, who was a sort of guardian to the well,
used all her rude eloquence to persuade Jane Thomas to put
her question, and at length she consented. Obeying the old
woman’s directions, she knelt on the mat of bright green
grass which grew around, and leaning over the well so as to
see her face in the water, she repeated after her instructor,</p>

<div class="verse">“Water, water, tell me truly,</div>

<div class="verse">Sick or well,—in the name of God?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some minutes passed in perfect silence, and anxiety was
rapidly turning cheeks and lips pale, when the colour rapidly
returned. There was a gush of clear water from below,
bubble rapidly followed bubble, sparkling brightly in the
morning sunshine. Full of joy, the young mother rose from
her knees, kissed her child, and exclaimed, “I am happy
now!”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading29">THE WELL OF ST KEYNE.</h3>

<p>St Keyne came to this well about five hundred years before
the Norman Conquest, and imparted a strange
virtue to its waters—namely, that whichever of a newly-married
couple should first drink thereof, was to enjoy the
sweetness of domestic sovereignty ever after.</p>

<p>Situated in a thickly-wooded district, the well of St
Keyne presents a singularly picturesque appearance. “Four
trees of divers kinds,” grow over the well, imparting a delightful
shade, and its clear waters spread an emerald luxuriance
around. Once, and once only, have I paid a visit to
this sacred spot. Then and there I found a lady drinking of
the waters from her thimble, and eagerly contending with
her husband, that the right to rule was hers. The man,
however, mildly insisted upon it that he had had the first
drink, as he had rushed before his wife, and dipping his
fingers into the waters, had sucked them. This the lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
contended was not drinking, and she, I have no doubt,
through life had the best of the argument.</p>

<p>Tonkin says, in his “History of Cornwall,” “Did it retain
this wondrous quality, as it does to this day the shape, I
believe there would be to it a greater resort of both sexes
than either to Bath or Tunbridge; for who would not be
fond of attaining this longed-for sovereignty?” He then
adds, “Since the writing of this, the trees were blown
down by a violent storm, and in their place Mr Rashleigh,
in whose land it is, has planted two oaks, an ash, and an
elm, which thrive well; but the wonderful arch is destroyed.”
The author can add to this that (as he supposes, owing to
the alteration made in the trees) the sovereign virtues of
the waters have perished.</p>

<p>Southey’s ballad will be remembered by most readers:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>It has been already stated that, sitting in St Michael’s
Chair, on the tower of the church of St Michael’s Mount, has
the same virtue as the waters of this well; and that this
remarkable power was the gift of the same St Keyne who
imparted such wonderful properties to this well.</p>

<p>Of the holy well at St Maddern, Carne<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> writes thus:—</p>

<p>“It has been contended that a virgin was the patroness
of this church—that she was buried at Minster—and that
many miracles were performed at her grave. A learned
commentator, however, is satisfied that it was St Motran,
who was one of the large company that did come from
Ireland with St Buriana, and he was slain at the mouth of
the Hayle; the body was begged, and afterwards buried here.
Near by was the miraculous Well of St Maddern, over which
a chapel was built, so sacred was it held. (This chapel was
destroyed by the fanaticism of Major Ceely in the days of
Cromwell.) It stood at no great distance on the moor, and
the soil around it was black and boggy, mingled with a gray
moorstone....</p>

<p>“The votaries bent awfully and tremblingly over its sedgy
bank, and gazed on its clear bosom for a few minutes ere
they proved the fatal ordeal; then an imploring look was
cast towards the figure of St Motran, many a crossing was
repeated, and at last the pin or pebble held aloof was
dropped into the depth beneath. Often did the rustic beauty
fix her eye intently on the bubbles that rose, and broke, and
disappeared; for in that moment the lover was lost, or the
faithful husband gained. It was only on particular days,
however, according to the increase or decrease of the moon,
that the hidden virtues of the well were consulted.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p class="center">MADRON WELL.</p>

<p>Of this well we have the following notice by William Scawen, Esq.,
Vice-Warden of the Stannaries. The paper from which we extract it, was
first printed by Davies Gilbert, Esq., F.R.S., as an appendix to his
“Parochial History of Cornwall.” Its complete title is, “Observations
on an Ancient Manuscript, entitled ‘Passio Christo,’ written in the Cornish
Language, and now preserved in the Bodleian Library; with an Account of
the Language, Manners, and Customs of the People of Cornwall, (from
a Manuscript in the Library of Thomas Artle, Esq., 1777)”:—</p>

<p>“Of St Mardren’s Well, (which is a parish west to the Mount,) a fresh
true story of two persons, both of them lame and decrepit, thus recovered
from their infirmity. These two persons, after they had applied themselves
to divers physicians and chirurgeons, for cure, and finding no success
by them, they resorted to St Mardren’s Well, and according to the ancient
custom which they had heard of, the same which was once in a year—to
wit, on Corpus Christi evening, to lay some small offering on the altar
there, and to lie on the ground all night, drink of the water there, and in
the morning after to take a good draught more, and to take and carry away
some of the water, each of them in a bottle, at their departure. This
course these two men followed, and within three weeks they found the
effect of it, and, by degrees their strength increasing, were able to move
themselves on crutches. The year following they took the same course
again, after which they were able to go with the help of a stick; and at
length one of them, John Thomas, being a fisherman, was, and is at this
day, able to follow his fishing craft. The other, whose name was William
Cork, was a soldier under the command of my kinsman, Colonel William
Godolphin, (as he has often told me,) was able to perform his duty, and
died in the service of his majesty King Charles. But herewith take also
this:—</p>

<p>“One Mr Hutchens, a person well known in those parts, and now lately
dead, being parson of Ludgvan, a near neighbouring parish to St Mardren’s
Well, he observed that many of his parishioners often frequented this
well superstitiously, for which he reproved them privately, and sometimes
publicly, in his sermons; but afterwards he, the said Mr Hutchens, meeting
with a woman coming from the well with a bottle in her hand, desired
her earnestly that he might drink thereof, being then troubled with cholical
pains, which accordingly he did, and was eased of his infirmity.” The
latter story is a full confutation of the former; for, if the taking the water
accidentally thus prevailed upon the party to his cure, as it is likely it
did, then the miracle which was intended to be by the ceremony of lying
on the ground and offering is wholly fled, and it leaves the virtue of the
water to be the true cause of the cure. And we have here, as in many
places of the land, great variety of salutary springs, which have diversity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of operations, which by natural reason have been found to be productive
of good effects, and not by miracle, as the vain fancies of monks and friars
have been exercised in heretofore.</p>

<p>Bishop Hale, of Exeter, in his “Great Mystery of Godliness,” says:—“Of
which kind was that noe less than miraculous cure, which, at St
Maddern’s Well, in Cornwall, was wrought upon a poore cripple; whereof,
besides the attestation of many hundreds of the neighbours, I tooke a
strict and impartial examination in my last triennial visitation there. This
man, for sixteen years, was forced to walke upon his hands, by reason of
the sinews of his leggs were soe contracted that he cold not goe or walke on
his feet, who upon monition in a dream to wash in that well, which
accordingly he did, was suddainly restored to the use of his limbs; and I
sawe him both able to walk and gett his owne maintenance. I found
here was neither art or collusion,—the cure done, the author our invisible
God,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Madron Well—and, I have no doubt, in many others—may be found
frequently the pins which have been dropped by maidens desirous of
knowing “when they were to be married.” I once witnessed the whole
ceremony performed by a group of beautiful girls, who had walked on a
May morning from Penzance. Two pieces of straw, about an inch long
each, were crossed and the pin run through them. This cross was then
dropped into the water, and the rising bubbles carefully counted, as they
marked the number of years which would pass ere the arrival of the happy
day. This practice also prevailed amongst the visitors to the well at the
foot of Monacuddle Grove, near St Austell.</p>

<p>On approaching the waters, each visitor is expected to throw in a
crooked pin; and, if you are lucky, you may possibly see the other pins
rising from the bottom to meet the most recent offering. Rags and votive
offerings to the genius of the waters are hung around many of the wells.
Mr Couch says:—“At Madron Well, near Penzance, I observed the custom
of hanging rags on the thorns which grew in the enclosure.”</p>

<p>Crofton Croker tells us the same custom prevails in Ireland; and Dr
O’Connor, in his “Travels in Persia,” describes the prevalence of this custom.</p>

<p>Mr Campbell,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> on this subject, writes:—“Holy healing wells are
common all over the Highlands, and people still leave offerings of pins
and nails, and bits of rag, though few would confess it. There is a
well in Islay where I myself have, after drinking, deposited copper caps
amongst a hoard of pins and buttons, and similar gear, placed in chinks
in the rocks and trees at the edge of the ‘Witches’ Well.’ There
is another well with similar offerings freshly placed beside it, in an
island in Loch Maree, in Ross-shire, and many similar wells are to be
found in other places in Scotland. For example, I learn from Sutherland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that ‘a well in the Black Isle of Cromarty, near Rosehaugh, has
miraculous healing powers. A country woman tells me, that about forty
years ago, she remembers it being surrounded by a crowd of people every
first Tuesday in June, who bathed and drank of it before sunrise. Each
patient tied a string or rag to one of the trees that overhung it before
leaving. It was sovereign for headaches. Mr —— remembers to have
seen a well, here called Mary’s Well, hung round with votive rags.’”</p>

<p>Well-worship is mentioned by Martin. The custom, in his day, in the
Hebrides, was to walk south round about the well.</p>

<p>Sir William Betham, in his “Gael and Cymbri,” (Dublin: W. Curry,
Jun., &amp; Co., 1834,) says, at page 235:—“The Celtæ were much addicted to
the worship of fountains and rivers as divinities. They had a deity called
Divona, or the river-god.”</p>

</div>

<h3 id="heading31">THE WELL AT ALTAR-NUN. CURE OF INSANITY.</h3>

<p>Amongst the numerous holy wells which exist in Cornwall,
that of Alternon, or Altar-Nun, is the only one,
as far as I can learn, which possessed the virtue of curing
the insane.</p>

<p>We are told that Saint Nunne or Nuanita was the daughter
of an Earl of Cornwall, and the mother of St David;
that the holy well, which is situated about a mile from the
cathedral of St David, was dedicated to her; and that she
bestowed on the waters of the Cornish well those remarkable
powers, which were not given to the Welsh one, from
her fondness for the county of her birth.</p>

<p>Carew, in his “Survey of Cornwall,” thus describes the
practice:—</p>

<p>“The water running from St Nun’s well fell into a square
and enclosed walled plot, which might be filled at what depth
they listed. Upon this wall was the frantic person put to
stand, his back towards the pool, and from thence, with a
sudden blow in the breast, tumbled headlong into the pond;
where a strong fellow, provided for the nonce, took him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tossed him up and down, alongst and athwart the water, till
the patient, by foregoing his strength, had somewhat forgot
his fury. Then was he conveyed to the church, and certain
masses said over him: upon which handling, if his right
wits returned, St Nun had the thanks; but if there appeared
small amendment, he was bowssened again and again,
while there remained in him any hope of life or recovery.”</p>

<p>The 2d of March is dedicated to St Nun, and the influence
of the water is greatly exalted on that day.</p>

<p>Although St Nun’s well has been long famous, and the
celebrity of its waters extended far, yet there was a belief
prevailing amidst the uneducated, that the sudden shock
produced by suddenly plunging an insane person into water
was most effective in producing a return to reason.</p>

<p>On one occasion, a woman of weak mind, who was suffering
under the influence of a religious monomania, consulted
me on the benefit she might hope to receive from electricity.
The burden of her ever-melancholy tale was, that “she had
lost her God;” and she told me, with a strange mixture of
incoherence and reason, that her conviction was that a sudden
shock would cure her. She had herself proposed to her
husband and friends that they should take her to a certain
rock on St Michael’s Mount, stand her on it, with her back
to the sea, when “the waters were the strongest, at the
flowing of the tide;” and after having prayed with her, give
her the necessary blow on the chest, and thus plunge her
into the waters below. I know not that the experiment was
ever made in the case of this poor woman, but I have heard
of several instances where this sudden plunge had been tried
as a cure for insanity.</p>

<p>Mr T. Q. Couch thus describes the present condition of
this well in a paper on “Well-Worship:”—<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the western side of the beautiful valley through
which flows the Trelawney River, and near Hobb’s Park, in
the parish of Pelynt, Cornwall, is St Nun’s, or St Ninnie’s
Well. Its position was, until lately, to be discovered by the
oak-tree matted with ivy, and the thicket of willow and
bramble which grew upon its roof. The front of the well is
of a pointed form, and has a rude entrance about four feet
high, and spanned above by a single flat stone, which leads
into a grotto with arched roof. The walls on the interior
are draped with luxuriant fronds of spleenwort, hart’s tongue,
and a rich undercovering of liverwort. At the further end
of the floor is a round granite basin, with a deeply moulded
brim, and ornamented on its circumference with a series of
rings, each enclosing a cross or a ball. The water weeps
into it from an opening at the back, and escapes again by a
hole in the bottom. This interesting piece of antiquity has
been protected by a tradition which we could wish to attach
to some of our cromlechs and circles in danger of spoliation.”</p>

<p>According to the narrative given by Mr Bond in his
“History of Looe,” the sacred protection given must have
been limited in time, as the following story will prove:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“KIPPISCOMBE LANE,</p>

<p>Probably so called from a consecrated well on the right
hand side of the road. The titular saint of this well is
supposed to have been St Cuby, now corrupted into Keby’s
Well. The spring flows into a circular basin or reservoir of
granite, or of some stone like it, two feet four inches at its
extreme diameter at top, and about two feet high. It
appears to have been neatly carved and ornamented in its
lower part with the figure of a griffin, and round the edge
with dolphins, now much defaced. The water was formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
carried off by a drain or hole at the bottom, like those
usually seen in fonts and piscinas. This basin (which I
take to be an old font) was formerly much respected by the
neighbours, who conceived some great misfortune would
befall the person who should attempt to remove it from
where it stood, and that it required immense power to
remove it. A daring fellow, however, (says a story,) once
went with a team of oxen for the express purpose of removing
it. On his arrival at the spot, one of the oxen fell down
dead, which so alarmed the fellow that he desisted from the
attempt he was about to make. There are several loose
stones scattered round this basin or reservoir, perhaps the
remains of some building which formerly enclosed it—a
small chapel likely. The last time I saw this reservoir
it had been taken many feet from where it used to stand,
and a piece of the brim of it had been recently struck
off.”</p>

<h3 id="heading32">ST GUNDRED’S WELL AT ROACH ROCK.</h3>

<p>Carew, in his “Survey of Cornwall,” p. 139, (p. 324, Lord
Dunstanville’s edit.,) tells us, “near this rock there is
another which, having a pit in it, containeth water which
ebbs and flows as the sea does. I was thereupon very curious
to inspect this matter, and found it was only a hole artificially
cut in a stone, about twelve inches deep and six broad;
wherein after rayne, a pool of water stands, which afterwards
with fair weather vanisheth away, and is dried up; and then
again, on the falling of rain, water is replenished accordingly,
which with dry weather abates as aforesaid, (for upon those
occasions I have seen it to have water in its pit, and again
to be without it,) which doubtless gave occasion to the
feigned report that it ebbs and flows as the sea:” of all which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
premisses thus speaks Mr Carew further, out of the Cornish
“Wonder Gatherer”:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“You neighbour scorners, holy, proud,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">Fame says its, be it soe.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The last tradition of this hermitage chapel is, that when
it was kept in repair, a person diseased with a grievous
leprosy, was either placed or fixed himself therein, where he
lived until the time of his death, to avoid infecting others.
He was daily attended with meat, drink, and washing by his
daughter, named Gunnett or Gundred, and the well hereby
from whence she fetched water for his use is to this day
shewn, and called by the name of St Gunnett’s Well, or St
Gundred’s Well.</p>

<p>It is not possible to give even the names of the wells which
are still thought to have “some healing virtue” in them.
The typical wells have alone been mentioned, and to these
brief notices of a few others may be added.</p>

<h3 id="heading33">ST CUTHBERT’S OR CUBERT’S WELL.</h3>

<p>Hal thus describes this famous place:—“In this parish
is that famous and well-known spring of water, called
Holy-well, (so named, the inhabitants say, for that the virtues
of this water was first discovered on All-Hallows day.) The
same stands in a dark cavern of the seacliff rocks, beneath
full seamark on spring-tides, from the top of which cavern
falls down or distills continually drops of water from the
white, blue, red, and green veins of those rocks. And accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the place where those drops of water fall, it
swells to a lump of considerable bigness, and there petrifies
to the hardness of ice, glass, or freestone, of the several
colours aforesaid, according to the nature of those veins in
the rock from whence it proceeds, and is of a hard, brittle
nature, apt to break like glass.</p>

<p>“The virtues of this water are very great. It is incredible
what numbers in summer-season frequent this place and
waters from counties far distant.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading34">RICKETY CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>The practice of bathing rickety children on the first three
Wednesdays in May is still far from uncommon in the
outlying districts of Cornwall. The parents will walk many
miles for the purpose of dipping the little sufferers in some
well, from which the “healing virtue” has not entirely departed.
Among these holy wells, Cubert, just named, is far-famed.
To this well the peasantry still resort, firm in the
faith that there, at this especial season, some mysterious
virtue is communicated to its waters. On these occasions,
only a few years since, the crowd assembled was so large,
that it assumed the character of a fair.</p>

<h3 id="heading35">CHAPELL UNY.</h3>

<p>On the first three Wednesdays in May, children suffering
from mesenteric diseases are dipped three times in this
well, <i>against the sun</i>, and <i>dragged</i> three times around the
well on the grass, in the same direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading36">PERRAN WELL.</h3>

<p>Children were cured of several diseases by being bathed
in this well. They were also carried to the sea-shore, and
passed through a cleft in a rock on the shore at Perranzabalo.
In the autumn of 1863 I sought for these holy waters.
I was informed that some miners, in driving an adit, had
tapped the spring and drained it. There is not, therefore,
a trace of this once most celebrated well remaining. It was
with difficulty that its site could be discovered. I have since
learned that the cut stone-work which ornamented this holy
place, was removed to Chiverton, for the purpose of preserving
it.</p>

<h3 id="heading37">REDRUTH WELL.</h3>

<p>No child christened in this well has ever been hanged.
Saint Ruth, said to have been called Red Ruth, because
she always wore a scarlet cloak, especially blessed, to this
extent, those waters. I believe the population in this large
parish cares but little now, whether their children be baptized
with this well water or any other; but, half a century since,
it was very different. Then, many a parent would insist on
seeing the water taken from the well and carried to the font
in the church.</p>

<h3 id="heading38">HOLY WELL AT LITTLE CONAN.</h3>

<p>On Palm Sunday the people resorted to the well sacred to
“Our Lady of Nant’s,” with a cross of palm, and
after making the priest a present, they were allowed to throw
the cross into the well; if it swam the thrower was to outlive
the year, if it sank he was not.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading39">THE PRESERVATION OF HOLY WELLS.</h3>

<p>It is a very common notion amongst the peasantry, that a
just retribution overtakes those who wilfully destroy
monuments, such as stone circles, crosses, wells, and the like.
Mr Blight writes me—“Whilst at Boscaswell, in St Just, a
few weeks since, an old man told me, that a person who
altered an old Holy Well there, was drowned the next day in
sight of his home, and that a person who carried away the
stones of an ancient chapel, had his house burned down that
very night.” We hope the certainty of punishment will
prevent any further spoliation. Cannot we do something
towards the preservation of our antiquities? I quote from a
local paper the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the attention of the members of the Penzance Antiquarian Society
were directed to the state of the ‘Holy Well’ at Laneast, and the remains
of the Old Chapel Park, St Clether, they might perhaps induce the proprietors
of these ‘remnants of antiquity’ to bestow a little care on the
same, and arrest their further ruin and destruction. Many other ‘objects
of interest’ are in a sad state of neglect, and fast ‘fading away.’ Slaughtor
Bridge, near Camelford, has completely vanished. This is much to be
regretted, and is a double loss—first, to those who delight in these ‘memorials
of the past,’ and also to the town and neighbourhood, depriving
them of an attraction that has induced many strangers of taste to pay
them a visit.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">The scarcity of traditions connected with King
Arthur is not a little remarkable in Cornwall,
where he is said to have been born, and where
we believe him to have been killed. In the
autumn of last year (1863) I visited Tintagel and Camelford.
I sought with anxiety for some stories of the British
king, but not one could be obtained. The man who has
charge of the ruins of the castle—was very sorry that he had
lent a book which he once had, and which contained many
curious stories, but he had no story to tell me.</p>

<p>We hear of Prince Arthur at the Land’s End, and of his
fights with the Danes in two or three other places. Merlin,
who may be considered as especially associated with Arthur,
has left indications of his presence here and there, in prophetic
rhymes not always fulfilled; but of Arthur’s chieftains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
we have no folk-lore. All the rock markings, or rock
peculiarities, which would in West Cornwall have been given
to the giants, are referred to King Arthur in the eastern
districts.</p>

<p>Jack the Giant Killer and Thomas Thumb—the former
having been tutor, in his own especial calling, to King
Arthur’s only son,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and the latter the king’s favourite dwarf<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>—are,
except in story-books, unknown. Jack Hornby,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>—if
he ever lived near the Land’s End, unless he is the same
with “Little Jack Horner,”—has been so long a stranger,
that his name is forgotten.</p>

<p>The continuance of a fixed belief in the existence of
Arthur is easily explained. The poets and the romance
writers have made the achievements of a British chieftain
familiar to all the people; and Arthur has not only a name,
but a local habitation given to him equally in Scotland,
England, Wales, and Ireland.</p>

<p>Mr Campbell, in his “West Highland Tales,” gives a
“Genealogy Abridgment of the very ancient and noble
family of Argyle, 1779.” The writer says this family began
with Constantine, grandfather to King Arthur; and he informs
us that Sir Moroie Mor, a son of King Arthur, of
whom great and strange things are told in the Irish traditions—who
was born at Dumbarton Castle, and who was
usually known as “The Fool of the Forest”—was the real
progenitor of “Mac Callen Mor.” From this Moroie Mor
was derived the mighty Diarmaid, celebrated in many a
Gaelic lay—“to whom all popular traditions trace the Campbell
clan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Arthur and Diarmaid,” writes Mr Campbell, “primeval
Celtic worthies, whose very existence the historian ignores,
are thus brought together by a family genealogist.”</p>

<p>“Was the Constantine grandfather to Arthur one of
the five tyrants named by Gildas?”—I quote from Camden<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and Milton.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><i>Constantinus</i>, son of Cador, Duke of Cornwall, Arthur’s
half-brother by the mother’s side, “a tyrannical and bloody
king.”</p>

<p><i>Aurelius Conanus</i>, who “wallowed in murder and adultery.”</p>

<p><i>Vortipore</i>, “tyrant of the Dimeta.”</p>

<p><i>Cuneglas</i>, “the yellow butcher.”</p>

<p><i>Maglocunes</i>, “the island dragon.”</p>

<p>It is curious to find a Scotch genealogist uniting in one
bond the Arthur of Dundagel and the ancestors of the
Argyles of Dumbarton.</p>

<p>May we not after this venture to suggest that, in all probability,
the parish of Constantine, (pronounced, however,
<i>Cus-ten-ton</i>,) between Helstone and Penryn, may derive its
name from this Constantinus, rather than from the first
Christian emperor.</p>

<p>Again, the family of Cossentine has been often said to
be offsets from Constantine, the descendant of the Greek
emperors, who was buried in Landulph church. Seeing that
the name has been known for so long a period in Cornwall,
may not this family rather trace their origin up to this
Constantine the Tyrant?</p>

<h3 id="heading41">THE BATTLE OF VELLAN-DRUCHAR.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></h3>

<p>The Sea Kings, in their predatory wanderings, landed in
Genvor Cove, and, as they had frequently done on previous
occasions, they proceeded to pillage the little hamlet of
Escols. On one occasion they landed in unusually large
numbers, being resolved, as it appeared, to spoil many of the
large and wealthy towns of Western Cornwall, which they
were led to believe were unprotected. It fortunately happened
that the heavy surf on the beach retarded their landing,
so that the inhabitants had notice of their threatened invasion.</p>

<p>That night the beacon fire was lit on the chapel hill,
another was soon blazing on Castle-an-dinas, and on Trecrobben.
Carn Brea promptly replied, and continued the
signal-light, which also blazed lustrously that night on St
Agnes Beacon. Presently the fires were seen on Belovely
Beacon, and rapidly they appeared on the Great Stone, on
St Bellarmine’s Tor, and Cadbarrow, and then the fires blazed
out on Roughtor and Brownwilly, thus rapidly conveying
the intelligence of war to Prince Arthur and his brave
knights, who were happily assembled in full force at Tintagel
to do honour to several native Princes who were at that
time on a visit to the King of Cornwall. Arthur, and nine
other kings, by forced marches, reached the neighbourhood
of the Land’s-End at the end of two days. The Danes
crossed the land down through the bottoms to the sea on
the northern side of the promontory, spreading destruction
in their paths. Arthur met them on their return, and gave
them battle near Vellan-Druchar. So terrible was the
slaughter, that the mill was worked with blood that day.
Not a single Dane of the vast army that had landed escaped.
A few had been left in charge of the ships, and as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
they learned the fate of their brethren, they hastened to
escape, hoping to return to their own northern land. A
holy woman, whose name has not been preserved to us,
“brought home a west wind” by emptying the Holy Well
against the hill, and sweeping the church from the door to
the altar. Thus they were prevented from escaping, and
were all thrown by the force of a storm and the currents
either on the rocky shore, or on the sands, where they were
left high and dry. It happened on the occasion of an extraordinary
spring-tide, which was yet increased by the wind, so
that the ships lay high up on the rocks, or on the sands; and
for years the birds built their nests in the masts and rigging.</p>

<p>Thus perished the last army of Danes who dared to land
upon our western shores.</p>

<p>King Arthur and the nine kings pledged each other in the
holy water from St Sennen’s Well, they returned thanks for
their victory in St Sennen’s Chapel, and dined that day on
the Table-men.</p>

<p>Merlin, the prophet, was amongst the host, and the feast
being ended, he was seized with the prophetic afflatus, and
in the hearing of all the host proclaimed—</p>

<h3 id="heading42">ARTHUR AT THE LAND’S-END.</h3>

<p>Bolerium, or <i>Bellerium</i>, is the name given by the
ancients to the Land’s-End. Diodorus writes, Belerium;
Ptolemy, Bolerium. Milton adopts this name in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
“Lycidas,” and leads his readers to infer that it was derived
from the Giant Bellerus. It is quite possible that in Milton’s
time the name of one of the numerous giants who appear to
have made the Lands-End district their dwelling-place,
might have still lived in the memories of men. Certain it
is no such a giant is remembered now.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In a map of Saxon England we find the Land’s-End
called Penꞃiðꞅꞇeoꞃꞇ, and in some early English books this
promontory is named <i>Penrhin-guard</i>, and <i>Penrlien-gard</i>,
said to signify the “Headland of Blood.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The old Cornish
people called this promontory “Pen-von-las,” the “End of
the Earth,” hence we derive the name of the Land’s-End.
May not this sanguinary name have been derived from a
fact, and that actually several battles were fought by the
Britons under the command of Arthur, with the Saxons or
the Danes, in this neighbourhood? We have not far off the
<i>Field of Slaughter</i>, “Bollait,” where the ancient people of
Cornwall made their final stand against the Saxons. On
this field flint arrow-heads have frequently been found. The
tradition of Vellan-Druchar, which is but one of several I
have heard of a similar character, points to the same idea.
Arthur, according to one story, held possession of Trereen
Castle for some time. Another castle on the north coast is
said to have been occupied by him. An old man living in
Pendean once told me that the land at one time “swarmed
with giants, until Arthur, the good king, vanished them all
with his cross-sword.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading43">TRADITIONS OF THE DANES IN CORNWALL.</h3>

<p>The Danes are said to have landed in several places
around the coast, and have made permanent settlements
in some parts. We have already spoken of the battle of
Vellan-druchar. In Sennen Cove there was for a long period
a colony of red-haired people,—indeed, I am informed some
of them still live on the spot,—with whom the other inhabitants
of the district refused to marry. Up to a very recent
period, in several of the outlying villages, a red-haired family
was “looked down” upon. “Oh, he or she is a red-haired
Daäne,” was a common expression of contempt.</p>

<p>There are several hills which bear the names of Danes’
castles—as Castle-an-Dinas, near Penzance, and another in
St Columb.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Another very remarkable earthwork in Perran
Zabula (<i>Caer-Dane</i>) is described by Hals.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Eventually the Danes are said to have made permanent
settlements in Cornwall, and to have lived on friendly terms
with the Britons.</p>

<p>The Danes and the Cornish are reported to have concentrated
their forces to oppose Egbert the Saxon. In 835 the combined
body are reported to have met, and fought a pitched
battle on Hengistendane, (now Hengistondown,) near Callington.
The Cornish were so totally routed, that Egbert
obliged the Danes to retire to their ships, and passed a law
“that no Briton should in future cross the Tamar, or set
foot on English ground, on pain of death.”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In 997 the Danes, sailing about Penwrith-steort, landed
in several places, foraged the country, burnt the towns, and
destroyed the people.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Many of the traditions which are given in different parts
of these volumes have much of the Danish element in them.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading44">KING ARTHUR IN THE FORM OF A CHOUGH.</h3>

<p>I quote the following as it stands:—<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In Jarvis’s translation of “Don Quixote,” book ii.,
chap. v., the following passage occurs:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Have you not read, sir,’ answered Don Quixote, ‘the
annals and histories of England, wherein are recorded the
famous exploits of King Arthur, whom, in our Castilian
tongue, we always call King Artus; of whom there goes an
old tradition, and a common one all over that kingdom of
Great Britain, that this king did not die, but that, by magic
art, he was turned into a raven; and that, in process of
time, he shall reign again and recover his kingdom and
sceptre, for which reason it cannot be proved that, from that
time to this, any Englishman has killed a raven?’</p>

<p>“My reason for transcribing this passage is to record the
curious fact that the legend of King Arthur’s existence in
the form of a raven was still repeated as a piece of folk lore
in Cornwall about sixty years ago. My father, who died about
two years since, at the age of eighty, spent a few years of his
youth in the neighbourhood of Penzance. One day he was
walking along Marazion Green with his fowling-piece on his
shoulder, he saw a raven at a distance, and fired at it. An
old man who was near immediately rebuked him, telling
him that he ought on no account to have shot at a raven, for
that King Arthur was still alive in the form of that bird.
My father was much interested when I drew his attention
to the passage which I have quoted above.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some of your Cornish or Welsh correspondents
may be able to say whether the legend is still known among
the people of Cornwall or Wales.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Edgar MacCulloch.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Guernsey.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>I have been most desirous of discovering if any such
legend as the above exists. I have questioned people in
every part of Cornwall in which King Arthur has been reported
to have dwelt or fought, and especially have I
inquired in the neighbourhood of Tintagel, which is reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to have been Arthur’s stronghold. Nowhere do I find the
raven associated with him, but I have been told that bad
luck would follow the man who killed a Chough, for Arthur
was transformed into one of these birds.</p>

<h3 id="heading45">THE CORNISH CHOUGH.</h3>

<p>The tradition relative to King Arthur and his transformation
into a raven, is fixed very decidedly on the
Cornish Chough, from the colour of its beak and talons.
The—</p>

<p class="noindent">are said to mark the violent end to which this celebrated
chieftain came.</p>

<h3 id="heading46">SLAUGHTER BRIDGE.</h3>

<p>Historians and poets have made the world familiar
with King Arthur. We know how Merlin deceived,
by his magic, the beautiful Igerna, so that she received
King Uter as her husband. We know also that Uter Pendragon
died, and that his son, by Igerna, reigned King of
Britain. How Arthur ruled, and how he slaughtered all the
enemies of Britain, is told in the chronicles. But even at
Tintagel<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> all is silent respecting the king or his celebrated
Round Table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the days of King Arthur the Mount of Cornwall was
kept by a monstrous giant,” is familiar to us all; and it is
curious to find a tradition that the extirpation of these
Titans was due to Arthur and Christianity, as already related.
At Slaughter Bridge I heard the story, but it did not
sound like a tradition; the true native character was not in
the narrative. That in 824 the Cornish and Saxons fought
so bloody a battle that the river ran red with blood. On
Slaughter Bridge Arthur is said to have killed his nephew,
Modred, but that, previously to this last fight, Modred
wounded his uncle with a poisoned sword, nearly in front of
Worthyvale House. A single stone laid over a stream, having
some letters cut on its lower surface, is believed to mark
the exact spot where Arthur received his death-wound.</p>

<h3 id="heading47">CAMELFORD AND KING ARTHUR.</h3>

<p>At the head of this river Alan is seated Camelford, otherwise
written Galleford, a small town. It was formerly
called Kambton, according to Leland, who tells us that
“Arthur, the British Hector,” was slain here, or in the valley
near it. He adds, in support of this, that “pieces of armour,
rings, and brass furniture for horses are sometimes digged up
here by the countrymen; and after so many ages, the tradition
of a bloody victory in this place is still preserved.” There
are also extant some verses of a Middle Age poet about
“Camels” running with blood after the battle of Arthur
against Modred.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

two of Gruter’s inscriptions.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Seeing that Arthur’s great battles were fought near this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
town, and on the banks of the river, may not the names
given to the town and river be derived from Camulus?</p>

<p>In a Welsh poem it is recited that Arthur, after the battle
of Camlan in Cornwall, was interred in the Abbey of Glastonbury,
before the high altar, without any external mark.
Henry II is said to have visited the abbey, and to have
ordered that the spot described by the bard should be
opened. We are told that at twenty feet deep they found
the body deposited under a large stone, with Arthur’s name
inscribed thereon.</p>

<p>Glastonbury Abbey is said to have been founded by Joseph
of Arimathea, in a spot anciently called the island or valley
of Avolmia or Avolon.</p>

<p>Bale, in his “Acts of English Votaries,” attests to the
finding of the remains of Arthur:—</p>

<p>“In Avallon, anno 1191, there found they the flesh bothe
of Arthur and of hys wyfe Guenever turned all into duste,
wythin theyr coffines of strong oke, the bones only remaynynge.
A monke of the same abbeye, standyng and
behouldyng the fine broydinges of the wommanis heare as

of his purpose. For so soon as they were touched they fell
all to powder.”</p>

<h3 id="heading48">DAMELIOCK CASTLE.</h3>

<p>This ancient British castle once stood in savage grandeur
a rival to Tintagel. Its ruins, which can scarcely be
traced, are in the parish of St Tudy. Here Gothlois of the
Purple Spear, Earl of Cornwall, fortified himself against Uter
Pendragon’s soldiery, and here he was slain. Gothlois, or
Gothlouis, was the husband of Igerna, who was so cruelly
deceived by Uter, and who became the mother of Arthur.</p>

<h3 id="heading49">CARLIAN IN KEA.</h3>

<p>One of the most celebrated of Arthur’s knights, Sir Tristram,
is said to have been born in this parish. A tradition
of this is preserved in the parish, but it is probably
derived from the verses of Thomas of Erceldoune, better
known as Thomas the Rhymer.</p>

<p class="dropcap">That a deep-rooted belief in the power of the
witch still lingers in the remote districts of Cornwall
cannot be denied. A gentleman, who has
for many years been actively engaged in a public
capacity, gives me, in reply to some questions which I put
to him relative to a witch or conjurer, much information,
which is embodied in this section.</p>

<p>A “cunning man” was long resident in Bodmin, to whom
the people from all parts of the country went to be relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of spells, under the influence of which either themselves or
their cattle were supposed to be suffering. Thomas ——,
who resided at Nanstallan, not far from the town of Bodmin,
was waylaid, robbed, and well thrashed on his way home from
market. This act, which was accompanied by some appearance
of brutality, was generally referred to one of the
dupes of his cunning. Howbeit, Thomas —— appears to
have felt that the place was getting too hot for him, for
he migrated to one of the parishes on the western side of the
Fowey river. Numerous instances are within my knowledge
of the belief which existed amongst the peasantry that
this man really possessed the power of removing the effects
of witchcraft. Thomas —— took up his abode for some
time with a small farmer, who had lost some cattle. These
losses were attributed to the malign influences of some evil-disposed
person; but as Thomas —— failed to detect the
individual, he with the farmer made many journeys to Exeter,
to consult the “White Witch,” who resided in that city.
Whether the result was satisfactory or otherwise, I have
never learned. Thomas ——, it must be remembered, was
only a “witch.” The term is applied equally to men as to
women. I never heard any uneducated person speak of a
“wizard.” There appear to be, however, some very remarkable
distinctions between a male and a female witch. The
former is almost always employed to remove the evil influences
exerted by the latter. Witches, such as Thomas,
had but limited power. They could tell who had been guilty
of ill-wishing, but they were powerless to break the spell
and “unbewitch” the sufferer. This was frequently accomplished
by the friends of the bewitched, who, in concert with
Thomas ——, would perform certain ceremonies, many of
them of an obscene, and usually of a blasphemous, character.
The “White Witch” was supposed to possess the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
power of removing the spell, and of punishing the individual
by whose wickedness the wrong had been inflicted.</p>

<p>Jenny Harris was a reputed witch. This woman, old,
poor, and, from the world’s ill usage, rendered malicious,
was often charged with the evils which fell upon cattle,
children, or, indeed, on men and women. On one occasion,
a robust and rough-handed washerwoman, who conceived
that she was under the spell of Jenny Harris, laid violent
hands on the aged crone, being resolved to “bring blood
from her.” The witch’s arm was scratched and gouged from
the elbow to the wrist, so that a sound inch of skin did not
exist. This violent assault became the subject of inquiry
before the magistrates, who fined the washerwoman five pounds
for the assault.</p>

<p>My correspondent writes:—“I was also present at a
magistrates’ meeting at the Porcupine Inn, near Tywardreath,
some years ago, when an old woman from Golant was brought
up for witchcraft. One farmer, who appeared against her,
stated that he had then six bullocks hanging up in chains in
his orchard, and he attributed their disease and death to the
poor old woman’s influence. The case was dismissed, but it
afforded a good deal of merriment. There was a dinner at
the inn after the meeting, and some of the farmers present
were disposed to ridicule the idea of witchcraft. I said, well
knowing their real views and opinions, ‘Gentlemen, it is all
well enough to laugh, but it appears to me to be a serious
matter.’ Upon which Mr ——, a farmer of ——, said,
‘You are right, Mr ——; I’ll tell of two cases in which
one family suffered severely,’ and he gave us the details of
the cases. All the others present had a case or two, each
one within his own experience to vouch for, and the whole
afternoon was spent telling witch stories.”</p>

<p>The extent to which this belief was carried within a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
recent period, may be inferred from the fact that,
on one occasion when the visitors were assembled at the
county asylum, a man residing at Callington came with the
mother of a poor imbecile patient, and sent his card to the
boardroom. This was inscribed with his name and M.A.
Upon being asked how he became a Master of Arts, he replied
that he was a “Master of Black Arts.” The object of
this fellow’s visit was, having persuaded the mother of his
power, to propose to the visitors that they should place the
imbecile girl in his care, upon his undertaking, on their paying
him five pounds, to cure her. Of course this was not
listened to. This fellow imposed upon people to such an
extent, that he was eventually tried at the sessions, under an
almost forgotten Act of Parliament, for witchcraft. The
impression on the mind of my informant is that the case
broke down.</p>

<h3 id="heading51">NOTES ON WITCHCRAFT.</h3>

<p>In confirmation of the melancholy facts related of the continuance
of the belief in witchcraft, I would give the
accompanying cuttings from the <i>West Briton</i> newspaper of
a very recent date:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">GROSS SUPERSTITION.</p>

<p>“During the week ending Sunday last, a ‘wise man’ from Illogan has
been engaged with about half-a-dozen witchcraft cases, one a young tradesman,
and another a sea-captain. It appears that the ‘wise man’ was in
the first place visited at his home by these deluded people at different
times, and he declared the whole of them to be spell-bound. In one case
he said that if the person had not come so soon, in about a fortnight he
would have been in the asylum; another would have had his leg broken;
and in every case something very direful would have happened. Numerous
incantations have been performed. In the case of a captain of a
vessel, a visit was paid to the sea-side, and while the ‘wise man’ uttered
some unintelligible gibberish, the captain had to throw a stone into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sea. So heavy was the spell under which he laboured, and which immediately
fell upon the ‘wise man,’ that the latter pretended that he could
scarcely walk back to Hayle. The most abominable part of the incantations
is performed during the hours of midnight, and for that purpose the
wretch sleeps with his victims, and for five nights following he had five
different bed-fellows. Having no doubt reaped a pretty good harvest
during the week, he returned to his home on Monday; but such was the
pretended effect produced by the different spells and witchcraft that fell
upon him from his many dupes, that two of the young men who had been
under his charge were obliged to obtain a horse and cart and carry him to
the Hayle station. One of the men, having had ‘two spells’ resting on him,
the ‘wise man’ was obliged to sleep with him on Saturday and Sunday
nights, having spent the whole of the Sunday in his diabolical work. It
is time that the police, or some other higher authorities, should take the
matter up, as the person alluded to is well known, and frequently visited
by the ignorant and superstitious.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">THE CASE OF GROSS SUPERSTITION AT HAYLE.</p>

<p>“In the <i>West Briton</i> of the 27th ult. we gave some particulars of several
cases of disgraceful fraud and delusion which had been practised by a pretended
‘wise man’ from Illogan, and of gross superstition and gullibility
on the part of his dupes. A correspondent has furnished us with the following
particulars relative to the antecedents of the pretended conjurer.
He states that James Thomas, the conjurer from the parish of Illogan,
married some time since the late celebrated Tammy Blee, of Redruth, who
afterwards removed to Helston and carried on as a fortune-teller, but
parted from her husband, James Thomas, on account of a warrant for his
apprehension having been issued against him by the magistrates of St Ives,
for attempting to take a spell from Mrs Paynter, through her husband,
William Paynter, who stated before the magistrates that he wanted to
commit a disgraceful offence. Thomas then absconded, and was absent
from the west of Cornwall for upwards of two years. His wife then stated
that the virtue was in her and not in him; that she was of the real ‘Pellar’
blood; and that he could tell nothing but through her. His greatest dupes
have been at St Just and Hayle, and other parts of the west of Cornwall.
He has been in the habit of receiving money annually for keeping witchcraft
from vessels sailing out of Hayle. He slept with several of his dupes
recently; and about a fortnight since he stated that he must sleep with
certain young men at Copperhouse, Hayle, in order to protect them from
something that was hanging over them, one of them being a mason and
another a miner, the two latter lately from St Just. He said himself this
week at Truro that he had cured a young man of St Erth, and was going
on Saturday again to take a spell from the father, a tin smelter. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
caused a great disturbance amongst the neighbours, by charging some with
having bewitched others. He is a drunken, disgraceful, beastly fellow, and
ought to be sent to the treadmill. One of the young men is now thoroughly
ashamed of himself to think he has been duped so by this scoundrel.
We have purposely withheld the names of a number of Thomas’s egregious
dupes, with which our correspondent has furnished us, believing that the
badgering which they have doubtless received from their friends has proved
a sufficient punishment to them, and that their eyes are now thoroughly
opened to the gross and disgraceful imposture that has been practised upon
them.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following is from the <i>Western Morning News</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">CALLING A WOMAN A WITCH.</p>

<p>“At the Liskeard police court, on Monday, Harriet King appeared before
the sitting magistrates charged with an assault on Elizabeth Wellington.
The complainant had called the mother of defendant a witch, and said she
had ill-wished a person, and the ill wish fell on the cat, and the cat died.
This annoyed the daughter, who retaliated by bad words and blows. The
magistrates expressed surprise at the cause of the assault, but as that had
been proved, they fined defendant 1s. and the costs, £1 in all.”</p>

</div>

<h3 id="heading52">ILL-WISHING.</h3>

<p>I give the following notices as I receive them:—“I caant
altogether exackly bleve in wiches at al,” said a good dame
to us; “but this I can tell ee, our John’s wife quarrelled
once with her next door neighbor’s wife, and when John
come home, like a husband always should, he took up for his
wife, ‘northin but nat’r’l chiel was a.’ Well, the woman took
a nif, and for a long time never spoke to our John; at laast,
after a bit, she used to speak to un, and like as if a was all
over, and she used to speak quite sochebl’ like. Well, John
alleas was very well when he used to meet her, but as soon
as ever he got underground, he was tooken ill to wonce;
when a dedn’t meet her, a was well enuf. Well, John was
advised to go to the ‘Peller,’ and off he went to Helstun sure
nuf, and the ‘Peller’ towld un to come so many times in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
months, and do something anorther, and towld un who a
was that hoverlooked un, and a was that vere woman.
Well, the ‘Peller’ towld John that if a dedn’t do it, a would
very likely die sudden. Our John, dear fellow, came home,
and got unbelieving, and dedn’t do as a was towld. Wat
was the konsikense? Why, in less than three months a was
a dead man. Not as I believe the woman’s a witch—no,
not I; but she had a evil mind, and what’s so bad as a evil
mind?”</p>

<p>“I used to have a woman meeting me,” said a fisherman,
“when I went a-fishing; and she used to wish me ‘a good
catch’ every time she seed me, and I was always sure to have
no luck whenever I met her; luck used to be good enough
other times. Well, I went to the ‘Peller,’ and done what he
told me I done, and the woman came and begged my pardon,
and my luck was good enough after that.” To what purpose
he had been lucky I could not divine, for he was miserably
clad, and I learned that his family were, like himself, miserable
and degraded.</p>

<p>In a certain cordwainer’s workshop, which we could name,
the following important information was afforded by a lady
customer. The worthy tradesman was bewailing the loss of
a good-sized pig that had sickened, and being afraid it would
die, he had drowned it, to make its death easier:—“If thee’st
only towld me afore, tha peg wud a bean wel enuf in a

<p>“Well,” said one of the company, “I believe I was ill-wished
once. I had a great beautiful cage, full of pretty
canaries. I hung them out one Sunday morning, and a
woman came along and asked me to let her have one of my
birds. ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘for half-a-crown.’ She said she
shouldn’t buy none. I told her I would not give her one,
and off she went. That day week I had not a bird left;
everybody said they was bethought me, and I suppose they
were; but this I do know, I lost all my canaries.”</p>

<p>Carne, in his “Legend of Pacorra,” well expresses the
belief in the power of ill wishes:—“Thriven!” said the
woman, with a bitter laugh; “not if my curse could avail,
should they thrive! and it has availed,” she continued, in a
lower tone. “You know the wasting illness that’s fallen on
all that cruel faggot, Dame Tredray’s children, that said
they ought to thraw me from the head of Tol-y-pedden, and
that I should neither be broken nor drowned; and the hard
squire of Pendine, that would ha’ had me burned in the
great bonfire upon the bicking,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> because King Harry had a

again, ken ye?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading53">THE “PELLER.”</h3>

<p>A man who has resided at several places on the south
coast was known by this name. He is said to be in
possession of no end of charms, and to possess powers, of
no common order, over this and the other world. “He is
able,” writes a friend, “to put ghosts, hobgoblins, and, I
believe, even Satan himself, to rest. I have known farmers,
well informed in many other matters, and members of religious
bodies, go to the ‘Peller’ to have the ‘spirits that
possessed the calves’ driven out; for they, the calves, ‘were
so wild, they tore down all the wooden fences and gates, and
must be possessed with the devil.’</p>

<p>“The ‘Peller’ always performs a cure; but as the evil
spirits must go somewhere, and as it is always to be feared
that they may enter into other calves or pigs, or, it may be,
even possess the bodies of their owners themselves, the ‘Peller’
makes it imperative that a stone wall shall be built around
the calves, to confine them for three times seven days, or
until the next moon is as old as the present one. This precaution
always results in taming the devils and the calves,
and consequently in curing them—the ‘Peller’ usually sending
the spirits to some very remote region, and chaining
them down under granite rocks.”</p>

<p>An old woman had long suffered from debility; but she
and her friends were satisfied that she had been ill-wished.
So she went to the “Peller.” He told her to buy a bullock’s
heart, and get a packet of pound pins. She was to stick the
heart as full of pins as she could, and “the body that ill-wished
her felt every pin run into the bullock’s heart same
as if they had been run into her.” The spell was taken off,
and the old woman grew strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>An old man living on Lady Downs had a lot of money
stolen from his house. He, too, went to the “Peller.” In
this case the magician performed the spells, and the man
was told the money would be returned. After a few days, it
was so; the money, during the night, was tied to the handle
of the door, and found there by the owner in the morning.</p>

<h3 id="heading54">BEWITCHED CATTLE.</h3>

<p>A farmer, who possessed broad acres, and who was in
many respects a sensible man, was greatly annoyed to
find that his cattle became diseased in the spring. Nothing
could satisfy him but that they were bewitched, and he was
resolved to find out the person who had cast the evil eye on
his oxen. According to an anciently-prescribed rule, the
farmer took one of his bullocks and bled it to death, catching
all the blood on bundles of straw. The bloody straw
was then piled into a heap, and set on fire. Burning with
a vast quantity of smoke, the farmer expected to see the
witch, either in reality or in shadow, amidst the smoke.</p>

<p>In this particular case he was to some extent gratified.
An old woman who lived in the adjoining village noticing
the fire and smoke,—with all a woman’s curiosity,—went to
Farmer ——’s field to see what was going on. She was instantly
pounced on by this superstitious man, and he would
no doubt have seriously ill-treated her, had not the poor,
and now terrified, old soul, who roused her neighbours by
her cries, been rescued by them. Every person knew this
poor woman to be a most inoffensive and good creature, and
consequently the farmer was only laughed at for sacrificing
thus foolishly one of his oxen.</p>

<p>Another farmer living in one of the western parishes was
constantly losing his cattle in the spring. Many persons said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
this was because they were nearly starved during the winter,
but he insisted upon it that he was ill-wished, and that a
blight was upon him.</p>

<p>At length, to break the spell, and discover the witch, he
betook himself to a conjuror (white witch) who lived near
the Lizard Point. This learned person, of whom several
other facts are told in these pages, told the farmer to bleed
the next animal when taken ill, and to receive the blood
upon straw, being careful not to lose any of it. Then the
straw and blood were to be burnt, and whilst the blood was
burning he would be certain of seeing the witch pass through
the smoke.</p>

<p>A young steer fell ill first; it was bled as ordered, the
blood caught upon the straw, and both carefully burnt.
While this was going on, female curiosity induced a poor
weak old woman to go into the field and see what was going
on. She was well known to all, and as guiltless as a child
of ill-wishing any body, but she was seen through the smoke
darted upon by the farmer, and cruelly ill-treated.</p>

<h3 id="heading55">HOW TO BECOME A WITCH.</h3>

<p>Touch a Logan stone nine times at midnight, and any
woman will become a witch. A more certain plan is
said to be—To get on the Giant’s Rock at Zennor Church-Town
nine times without shaking it. Seeing that this rock
was at one time a very sensitive Logan stone, the task was
somewhat difficult.</p>

<h3 id="heading56">CORNISH SORCERERS.</h3>

<p>The powers of the sorcerer appear to have been passed
on from father to son through a long succession of
generations. There are many families—the descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
from the ancient Cornish people—who are even yet supposed
to possess remarkable powers of one kind or another.
Several families, which have become extinct, are more especially
reputed by tradition to have had dealings with the
bad spirits, and many of them to have made compacts with
the Evil One himself. Amongst the most curious of the
stories once told,—I believe they are nearly all forgotten,—are
those connected with Pengerswick Castle. A small tower
alone remains to note the site of a once famous fortified
place. This castle was said to have been occupied, in the
time of Henry VIII., by a man who had committed some
great crime; but long previous to that period the place was
famous for its wickedness.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading57">HOW PENGERSWICK BECAME A SORCERER.</h3>

<p>The first Pengerswick, by whom the castle, which still
bears his name, was built, was a proud man, and desired
to ally himself with some of the best families of Cornwall. He
wished his son to wed a lady who was very much older than
himself, who is said to have been connected with the Godolphin
family. This elderly maiden had a violent desire either
for the young man or the castle—it is not very clear which.
The young Pengerswick gave her no return for the manifestations
of love which she lavished upon him. Eventually,
finding all her attempts to win the young man’s love were
abortive, and that all the love potions brewed for her by the
Witch of Fraddam were of no avail, she married the old
lord—mainly, it is said, to be revenged on the son.</p>

<p>The witch had a niece who, though poor, possessed considerable
beauty; she was called Bitha. This young girl
was frequently employed by her aunt and the lady of Godolphin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to aid them in their spells on the young Pengerswick,
and, as a natural consequence, she fell desperately in love
with him herself. Bitha ingratiated herself with the lady
of Pengerswick, now the stepmother of the young man, and
was selected as her maid. This gave her many opportunities
of seeing and speaking to young Pengerswick, and her passion
increased. The old stepdame was still passionately fond
of the young man, and never let a chance escape her which
she thought likely to lead to the excitement of passion in his
heart towards her. In all her attempts she failed. Her love
was turned to hate; and having seen her stepson in company
with Bitha, this hate was quickened by the more violent
jealousy. Every means which her wicked mind could
devise were employed to destroy the young man. Bitha had
learned from her aunt, the Witch of Fraddam, much of her
art, and she devoted herself to counteract the spells of her
mistress.</p>

<p>The stepmother, failing to accomplish her ends, resolved
to ruin young Pengerswick with his father. She persuaded
the old man that his son really entertained a violent passion
for her, and that she was compelled to confine herself to her
tower in fear. The aged woman prevailed on Lord Pengerswick
to hire a gang of outlandish sailors to carry his son
away and sell him for a slave, giving him to believe that she
should herself in a short time present him with an heir.</p>

<p>The young Pengerswick escaped all their plots, and at his
own good time he disappeared from the castle, and for a long
period was never heard of.</p>

<p>The mistress and maid plotted and counter-plotted to secure
the old Pengerswick’s wealth; and when he was on his deathbed,
Bitha informed him of the vile practices of his wife, and
consoled him with the information that he was dying from the
effects of poison given him by her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The young lord, after long years, returned from some
Eastern lands with a princess for his wife, learned in all the
magic sciences of those enchanted lands. He found his stepmother
shut up in her chamber, with her skin covered with
scales like a serpent, from the effects of the poisons which
she had so often been distilling for the old lord and his son.
She refused to be seen, and eventually cast herself into the
sea, to the relief of all parties.</p>

<p>Bitha fared not much better. She lived on the Downs in
St Hilary; and from the poisonous fumes she had inhaled,
and from her dealings with the devil, her skin became of the
colour of that of <i>a toad</i>.</p>

<h3 id="heading58">THE LORD OF PENGERSWICK AN ENCHANTER.</h3>

<p>The Lord of Pengerswick came from some Eastern clime,
bringing with him a foreign lady of great beauty. She
was considered by all an “outlandish” woman; and by many
declared to be a “Saracen.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> No one, beyond the selected
servants, was ever allowed within the walls of Pengerswick
Castle; and they, it was said, were bound by magic spells.
No one dared tell of anything transacted within the walls;
consequently all was conjecture amongst the neighbouring
peasantry, miners, and fishermen. Certain it was, they said,
that Pengerswick would shut himself up for days together in
his chamber, burning strange things, which sent their strong
odours,—not only to every part of the castle,—but for miles
around the country. Often at night, and especially in
stormy weather, Pengerswick was heard for hours together
calling up the spirits, by reading from his books in some
unknown tongue. On those occasions his voice would roll
through the halls louder than the surging waves which beat
against the neighbouring rocks, the spirits replying like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
roar of thunder. Then would all the servants rush in fright
from the building, and remain crowded together, even in the
most tempestuous night, in one of the open courts. Fearful,
indeed, would be the strife between the man and the demons;
and it sometimes happened that the spirits were too powerful
for the enchanter. He was, however, constantly and carefully
watched by his wife; and whenever the strife became
too serious, her harp was heard making the softest, the
sweetest music. At this the spirits fled; and they were
heard passing through the air towards the Land’s-End,
moaning like the soughing of a departing storm. The lights
would then be extinguished in the enchanter’s tower, and
all would be peace. The servants would return to their
apartments with a feeling of perfect confidence. They feared
their master, but their mistress inspired them with love.
Lady Pengerswick was never seen beyond the grounds surrounding
the castle. She sat all day in lonely state and
pride in her tower, the lattice-window of her apartment being
high on the seaward side. Her voice accompanying the
music of her harp was rarely heard, but when she warbled
the soft love strains of her Eastern land. Often at early
dawn the very fishes of the neighbouring bay would raise
their heads above the surface of the waters, enchanted by the
music and the voice; and it is said that the mermaids from
the Lizard, and many of the strange spirits of the waters,
would come near to Pengerswick cove, drawn by the same
influence. On moonlight nights the air has often seemed to
be full of sound, and yet the lady’s voice was seldom louder
than that of a warbling bird. On these occasions, men have
seen thousands of spirits gliding up and down the moonbeams,
and floating idly on the silvered waves, listening to,
and sometimes softly echoing, the words which Lady Pengerswick
sang. Long did this strange pair inhabit this lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
castle; and although the Lord of Pengerswick frequently
rode abroad on a most magnificent horse—which had the
reputation of being of Satanic origin, it was at once so docile
to its master and so wild to any other person,—yet he made
no acquaintance with any of the neighbouring gentry. He
was feared by all, and yet they respected him for many of the
good deeds performed by him. He completely enthralled
the Giants of the Mount; and before he disappeared from
Cornwall, they died, owing, it was said, to grief and want of
food.</p>

<p>Where the Lord of Pengerswick came from, no one knew;
he, with his lady, with two attendants, who never spoke in
any but an Eastern tongue, which was understood by none
around them, made their appearance one winter’s day, mounted
on beautiful horses, evidently from Arabia or some distant
land.</p>

<p>They soon—having gold in abundance—got possession of
a cottage; and in a marvellously short time the castle, which
yet bears his name, was rebuilt by this lord. Many affirm that
the lord by the force of his enchantments, and the lady by the
spell of her voice, compelled the spirits of the earth and air
to work for them; and that three nights were sufficient to
rear an enormous pile, of which but one tower now remains.</p>

<p>Their coming was sudden and mysterious; their going was
still more so. Years had rolled on, and the people around
were familiarised with those strange neighbours, from whom
also they derived large profits, since they paid whatsoever
price was demanded for any article which they required.
One day a stranger was seen in Market-Jew, whose face
was bronzed by long exposure to an Eastern sun. No one
knew him; and he eluded the anxious inquiries of the numerous
gossips, who were especially anxious to learn something
of this man, who, it was surmised by every one, must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
some connexion with Pengerswick or his lady; yet no one
could assign any reason for such a supposition. Week after
week passed away, and the stranger remained in the town,
giving no sign. Wonder was on every old woman’s lips, and
expressed in every old man’s eyes; but they had to wonder
on. One thing, it was said, had been noticed; and this
seemed to confirm the suspicions of the people. The stranger
wandered out on dark nights—spent them, it was thought, on
the sea-shore; and some fishermen said they had seen him
seated on the rock at the entrance of the valley of Pengerswick.
It was thought that the lord kept more at home than
usual, and of late no one had heard his incantation songs and
sounds; neither had they heard the harp of the lady. A very
tempestuous night, singular for its gloom—when even the
ordinary light, which, on the darkest night, is evident to the
traveller in the open country, did not exist—appears to have
brought things to their climax. There was a sudden alarm
in Market-Jew, a red glare in the eastern sky, and presently
a burst of flames above the hill, and St Michael’s Mount was
illuminated in a remarkable manner. Pengerswick Castle
was on fire; the servants fled in terror; but neither the lord
nor his lady could be found. From that day to the present
they were lost to all.</p>

<p>The interior of the castle was entirely destroyed; not a
vestige of furniture, books, or anything belonging to the
“Enchanter” could be found. He and everything belonging
to him had vanished; and, strange to tell, from that night
the bronzed stranger was never again seen. The inhabitants
of Market-Jew naturally crowded to the fire; and when all
was over they returned to their homes, speculating on the
strange occurrences of the night. Two of the oldest people
always declared that, when the flames were at the highest,
they saw two men and a lady floating in the midst of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
fire, and that they ascended from amidst the falling walls,
passed through the air like lightning, and disappeared.</p>

<h3 id="heading59">THE WITCH OF FRADDAM AND THE ENCHANTER OF
PENGERSWICK.</h3>

<p>Again and again had the Lord of Pengerswick reversed
the spells of the Witch of Fraddam, who was reported to
be the most powerful weird woman in the west country.
She had been thwarted so many times by this “white witch,”
that she resolved to destroy him by some magic more potent
than anything yet heard of. It is said that she betook herself
to Kynance Cove, and that there she raised the devil by
her incantations, and that she pledged her soul to him in
return for the aid he promised. The enchanter’s famous
mare was to be seduced to drink from a tub of poisoned
water placed by the roadside, the effect of which was to
render him in the highest degree restive, and cause him to
fling his rider. The wounded Lord of Pengerswick was, in
his agony, to be drenched, by the old witch, with some hell-broth,
brewed in the blackest night, under the most evil
aspects of the stars; by this he would be in her power for
ever, and she might torment him as she pleased. The devil
felt certain of securing the soul of the Witch of Fraddam,
but he was less certain of securing that of the enchanter.
They say, indeed, that the sorcery which Pengerswick learned
in the East was so potent, that the devil feared him. However,
as the proverb is, he held with the hounds and ran
with the hare. The witch collected with the utmost care
all the deadly things she could obtain, with which to brew
her famous drink. In the darkest night, in the midst of the
wildest storms, amidst the flashings of lightnings and the
bellowings of the thunder, the witch was seen riding on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
black ram-cat over the moors and mountains in search of
her poisons. At length all was complete—the horse drink
was boiled, the hell-broth was brewed. It was in March,
about the time of the equinox; the night was dark, and the
King of Storms was abroad. The witch planted her tub of
drink in a dark lane, through which she knew the Lord of
Pengerswick must pass, and near to it she sat, croning over
her crock of broth. The witch-woman had not long to wait;
amidst the hurrying winds was heard the heavy tramp of
the enchanter’s mare, and soon she perceived the outline of
man and horse defined sharply against the line of lurid
light which stretched along the western horizon. On they
came; the witch was scarcely able to contain herself—her
joy and her fears, struggling one with the other, almost overpowered
her. On came the horse and his rider: they neared
the tub of drink; the mare snorted loudly, and her eyes flashed
fire as she looked at the black tub by the roadside. Pengerswick
bent him over the horse’s neck and whispered into her
ear; she turns round, and, flinging out her heels, with one
kick she scattered all to the wild winds. The tub flew before
the blow; it rushed against the crock, which it overturned,
and striking against the legs of the old Witch of Fraddam,
she fell along with the tub, which assumed the shape of a
coffin. Her terror was extreme: she who thought to have
unhorsed the conjuror, found herself in a carriage for which
she did not bargain. The enchanter raised his voice and gave
utterance to some wild words in an unknown tongue, at
which even his terrible mare trembled. A whirlwind arose,
and the devil was in the midst of it. He took the coffin in
which lay the terrified witch high into the air, and the crock
followed them. The derisive laughter of Pengerswick, and
the savage neighing of the horse, were heard above the roar
of the winds. At length, with a satisfied tone, he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
“She is settled till the day of doom,” gave the mare the
spurs, and rode rapidly home.</p>

<p>The Witch of Fraddam still floats up and down, over the
seas, around the coast, in her coffin, followed by the crock,
which seems like a punt in attendance on a jolly-boat. She
still works mischief, stirring up the sea with her ladle and
broom till the waves swell into mountains, which heave off
from their crests, so much mist and foam, that these wild
wanderers of the winds can scarcely be seen through the
mist. Woe to the mariner who sees the witch!</p>

<p>The Lord of Pengerswick alone had power over her. He
had but to stand on his tower, and blow three blasts on his
trumpet, to summon her to the shore, and compel her to
peace.</p>

<h3 id="heading60">TREWA, OR TREWE; THE HOME OF WITCHES.</h3>

<p>As we walk from Nancledrea Bottoms towards Zennor we
pass Trewa, (pronounced <i>Truee</i>,) which is said to have
been the place where at midsummer all the witches of the
west met. Here are the remains of very ancient tin stream
works, and these, I was informed, “were the remains of bals
which had been worked before the deluge; there was nothing
so old anywhere else in Cornwall.” Around us, on the hillsides
and up the bottoms, huge boulders of granite are most
fantastically scattered. All these rocks sprang from the
ground at the call of the giants. At Embla Green we still
see the ruins of the Giant’s House, but all we know of this
Titan is that he was the king. On one side we have the
“Giant’s Well,” and not far off the “Druid’s Well,” and a
little before us is Zennor coit or cromlech.</p>

<p>From this point the scenery is of the wildest description.
The granite cairns are spread around in every direction, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
many of those masses are so strangely fashioned by the
atmospheric influences ever acting on them, that fancy can
readily fashion them into tombs and temples. Rock basins
abound on these hills, and of ruined cromlechs there are
many. Whatever the local historians may say, local traditions
assure us that on Midsummer Eve all the witches in Penwith
gathered here, and that they lit fires on every cromlech,
and in every rock basin, until the hills were alive with
flame, and renewed their vows to the evil ones from whom
they derived their power. Hence, to this day this place is
called Burn Downs. Amidst these rock masses there was one
pile remarkable amidst all the others for its size, and—being
formed of cubical masses—for its square character. This
was known as the Witches’ Rock, and here it was said they
assembled at midnight to carry on their wicked deeds. This
rock has been removed, and with it the witches have died;
the last real witch in Zennor having passed away, as I have
been told, about thirty years since, and with her, some say, the
fairies fled. I have, however, many reasons for believing
that our little friends have still a few haunts in this locality.
There is but one reason why we should regret the disappearance
of the Witches’ Rock. <i>Any one touching this rock
nine times at midnight was insured against bad luck.</i></p>

<h3 id="heading61">KENIDZHEK WITCH.</h3>

<p>On the tract called the “Gump,” near Kenidzhek, is a
beautiful well of clear water, not far from which was a
miner’s cot, in which dwelt two miners with their sister.
They told her never to go to the well after daylight; they
would fetch the water for her. However, on one Saturday
night she had forgotten to get in a supply for the morrow,
so she went off to the well. Passing by a gap in a broken-down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hedge (called a <i>gurgo</i>) near the well, she saw an old
woman sitting down, wrapped in a red shawl; she asked her
what she did there at that time of night, but received no
reply; she thought this rather strange, but plunged her
pitcher in the well; when she drew it up, though a perfectly
sound vessel, it contained no water; she tried again
and again, and, though she saw the water rushing in at the
mouth of the pitcher, it was sure to be empty when lifted
out. She then became rather frightened; spoke again to the
old woman, but receiving no answer, hastened away, and
came in great alarm to her brothers. They told her that it
was on account of this old woman they did not wish her to
go to the well at night. What she saw was the ghost of old
Moll, a witch who had been a great terror to the people in
her lifetime, and had laid many fearful spells on them.
They said they saw her sitting in the gap by the wall every
night when going to bed.</p>

<h3 id="heading62">THE WITCHES OF THE LOGAN STONE.</h3>

<p>Who that has travelled into Cornwall but has visited the
Logan Stone? Numerous Logan rocks exist on the
granite hills of the county, but that remarkable mass which
is poised on the cubical masses forming its Cyclopean
support, at Trereen, is beyond all others “The Logan
Stone.”</p>

<p>A more sublime spot could not have been chosen by the
Bardic priesthood for any ordeal connected with their worship;
and even admitting that nature may have disposed the
huge mass to wear away, so as to rest delicately poised on
a pivot, it is highly probable that the wild worship of the
untrained tribes, who had passed to those islands from the
shores of the Mediterranean Sea, may have led them to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that some superhuman power belonged to such a
strangely-balanced mass of rock.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more certain than that through all time,
passing on from father to son, there has been a wild reverence
of this mass of rock; and long after the days when the
Druid ceased to be, there is every reason for believing that
the Christian priests, if they did not encourage, did not
forbid, the use of this and similar rocks to be used as
places of ordeal by the uneducated and superstitious people
around.</p>

<p>Hence the mass of rock on which is poised the Logan
Stone has ever been connected with the supernatural. To
the south of the Logan Rock is a high peak of granite,
towering above the other rocks; this is known as the Castle
Peak.</p>

<p>No one can say for how long a period, but most certainly
for ages, this peak has been the midnight rendezvous for
witches. Many a man, and woman too, now sleeping quietly
in the churchyard of St Levan, would, had they the power,
attest to having seen the witches flying into the Castle Peak
on moonlight nights, mounted on the stems of the ragwort,
(<i>Senécio Jacobæa Linn</i>,) and bringing with them the things
necessary to make their charms potent and strong.</p>

<p>This place was long noted as the gathering-place of the
army of witches who took their departure for Wales, where
they would luxuriate at the most favoured seasons of the
year upon the milk of the Welshmen’s cows. From this
peak many a struggling ship has been watched by a malignant
crone, while she has been brewing the tempest to destroy
it; and many a rejoicing chorus has been echoed, in
horror, by the cliffs around, when the witches have been
croaking their miserable delight over the perishing crews, as
they have watched man, woman, and child drowning, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
they were presently to rob of the treasures they were bringing
home from other lands.</p>

<p>Upon the rocks behind the Logan Rock it would appear
that every kind of mischief which can befall man or beast
was once brewed by the St Levan witches.</p>

<h3 id="heading63">MADGY FIGGY’S CHAIR.</h3>

<p>All those who have visited the fine piles of rocks in the
vicinity of the so-called “St Levan,” Land’s-End,
called Tol-pedden-Penwith,—and infinitely finer than anything
immediately surrounding the most western promontory
itself,—cannot have failed to notice the arrangement of cubical
masses of granite piled one upon the other, known as the
<i>Chair Ladder</i>.</p>

<p>This remarkable pile presents to the beat of the Atlantic
waves a sheer face of cliff of very considerable height, standing
up like a huge basaltic column, or a pillar built by the
Titans, the horizontal joints representing so many steps in
the so-called “Ladder.” On the top is placed a stone of
somewhat remarkable shape, which is by no great effort of
the imagination converted into a chair. There it was that
Madgy Figgy, one of the most celebrated of the St Levan
and Burian witches, was in the habit of seating herself when
she desired to call up to her aid the spirits of the storm.
Often has she been seen swinging herself to and fro on this
dizzy height when a storm has been coming home upon the
shores, and richly-laden vessels have been struggling with
the winds. From this spot she poured forth her imprecations
on man and beast, and none whom she had offended
could escape those withering spells; and from this “chair,”
which will ever bear her name, Madgy Figgy would always
take her flight. Often, starting like some huge bird, mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
on a stem of ragwort, Figgy has headed a band of inferior
witches, and gone off rejoicing in their iniquities to Wales
or Spain.</p>

<p>This old hag lived in a cottage not far from Raftra, and
she and all her gang, which appears to have been a pretty
numerous crew, were notorious wreckers. On one occasion,
Madgy from her seat of storms lured a Portuguese Indiaman
into Perloe Cove, and drowned all the passengers. As
they were washed on shore, the bodies were stripped of everything
valuable, and buried by Figgy and her husband in the
green hollow, which may yet be seen, just above Perloe Cove,
marking the graves with a rough stone placed at the head
of the corpse. The spoils on this occasion must have been
large, for all the women were supplied for years with rich
dresses, and costly jewels were seen decking the red arms of
the girls who laboured in the fields. For a long time gems
and gold continued to be found on the sands. Howbeit,
amongst the bodies thrown ashore was one of a lady richly
dressed, with chains of gold about her. “Rich and rare were
the gems she wore,” and not only so, but valuable treasure was
fastened around her, she evidently hoping, if saved, to secure
some of her property. This body, like all the others, was
stripped; but Figgy said there was a mark on it which
boded them evil, and she would not allow any of the gold or
gems to be divided, as it would be sure to bring bad luck
if it were separated. A dreadful quarrel ensued, and bloodshed
was threatened; but the diabolical old Figgy was more
than a match for any of the men, and the power of her impetuous
will was superior to them all.</p>

<p>Everything of value, therefore, belonging to this lady was
gathered into a heap, and placed in a chest in Madgy Figgy’s
hut. They buried the Portuguese lady the same evening;
and after dark a light was seen to rise from the grave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
pass along the cliffs, and seat itself in Madgy’s chair at Tol-Pedden.
Then, after some hours, it descended, passed back
again, and, entering the cottage, rested upon the chest. This
curious phenomenon continued for more than three months,—nightly,—much
to the alarm of all but Figgy, who said she
knew all about it, and it would all be right in time. One
day a strange-looking and strangely-attired man arrived at
the cottage. Figgy’s man (her husband) was at home alone.
To him the stranger addressed himself by signs,—he could
not speak English, so he does not appear to have spoken at
all,—and expressed a wish to be led to the graves. Away they
went, but the foreigner did not appear to require a guide.
He at once selected the grave of the lady, and sitting down
upon it, he gave vent to his pent-up sorrows. He sent Figgy’s
man away, and remained there till night, when the light
arose from the grave more brilliant than ever, and proceeded
directly to the hut, resting as usual on the chest, which was
now covered up with old sails, and all kinds of fishermen’s
lumber.</p>

<p>The foreigner swept these things aside, and opened the
chest. He selected everything belonging to the lady, refusing
to take any of the other valuables. He rewarded the wreckers
with costly gifts, and left them—no one knowing from whence
he came nor whither he went. Madgy Figgy was now truly
triumphant. “One witch knows another witch, dead or living,”
she would say; “and the African would have been the death
of us if we hadn’t kept the treasure, whereas now we have
good gifts, and no gainsaying ’em.” Some do say they have
seen the light in Madgy Figgy’s chair since those times.</p>

<h3 id="heading64">OLD MADGE FIGGEY AND THE PIG.</h3>

<p>Madge Figgey once lived in St Leven, but she removed
to Burian Church-town. She had a neighbour,
Tom Trenoweth, who had a very fine sow, and the old creature
took it into her head to desire this sow. The pig was
worth a pound of any man’s money, but Madge offered Tom
five shillings for it.</p>

<p>“No,” says Tom, “I shan’t sell the sow to you, nor to
anybody else. I am going to put her in the house, and feed
her for myself against winter.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said old Madge, nodding her head, and shaking
her finger at Tom, “you will wish you had.”</p>

<p>From that time the sow ceased to “goody” (thrive.) The
more corn the sow ate, the leaner she became. Old Madge
came again, “Will ye sell her now, Tom?”</p>

<p>“No! and be —— to you,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Arreah, Tom! you will wish you had, before another
week is ended, I can tell ye.”</p>

<p>By next week the sow was gone to skin and bone, yet eating
all the time meat enough for three.</p>

<p>At last Tom took the sow out of the house, and prepared
to drive her to Penzance market, and sell her for what she
would fetch.</p>

<p>The rope was put round her leg, but more for fashion’s
sake than anything else. The poor pig could scarcely stand
on her legs, consequently there was little chance of her running
away. Well, Tom and his pig were no sooner on the
highroad than the sow set off like a greyhound, and never
stopped, racing over hedges and ditches, until she reached
Leah Lanes. Tom kept hold of the rope till his arm was
almost dragged from his body, and he was fairly “out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
breath.” He dropped the rope, piggy went on “as quiet as
a lamb,” but only the way which pleased her best. At last
Tom and the sow arrived at Tregenebris Downs. At the
corner of the roads, where they divide,—one going to Sancreed,
and the other to Penzance,—Tom again laid hold of
the rope, and said to himself, “I’ll surely get thee to Penzance
yet.”</p>

<p>The moment they came to the market-road, the sow made
a bolt, jerked the rope out of Tom’s hand, and ran off at full
speed, never stopping until she got in under Tregenebris
Bridge. Now that bridge is more like a long drain—locally
a bolt—than anything else, and is smallest in the middle;
so when the sow got half way in, she stuck fast; she couldn’t
go forward—she wouldn’t come back. Tom fired all the
stones he could find,—first at the pig’s head, and then at her
tail,—and all he got for his pains was a grunt. There he
stopped, watching the sow till near sunset; he had eaten
nothing since five in the morning, and was starving. He
saw no chance of getting the sow out, so he swore at her,
and prepared to go home, when who should come by but old
Madge Figgey, with her stick in one hand and basket in the
other.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, is that you? What in the world are ye doing
here at this time o’ day?”</p>

<p>“Well,” says Tom, “I’m cussed if I can tell; look under
the bridge, if you’re a mind to know.”</p>

<p>“Why, I hear the sow grunting, I declare. What will ye
sell her for now?”</p>

<p>“If you can get her out, take her,” says Tom; “but hast
anything to eat in your basket?”</p>

<p>Madge gave him a twopenny loaf.</p>

<p>“Thank ye,” says Tom. “Now the devil take the both of
ye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cheat! cheat! cheat!” says Madge. Out came the
sow, and followed her home like a dog.</p>

<h3 id="heading65">MADAM NOY AND OLD JOAN.</h3>

<p>They say that, a long time since, there lived an old witch
down by Alsia Mill, called Joan. Everybody feared
to offend the old woman, and gave her everything she looked
for, except Madam Noy, who lived in Pendrea.</p>

<p>Madam Noy had some beautiful hens of a new sort, with
“cops” on their heads.</p>

<p>One morning early, Joan comes up to Pendrea, so as to
catch Madam Noy going out into the farmyard, with her
basket of corn to feed the poultry, and to collect the eggs.</p>

<p>Joan comes up nodding and curtsying every step. “Good
morrow to your honour; how well you are looking, Madam
Noy; and, oh, what beautiful hens. I’ve got an old hen
that I do want to set; will you sell me a dozen of eggs?
Those with the ‘cops’ I’d like to have best.”</p>

<p>Madam turned round half offended, and said, “I have
none to sell, neither with the cops nor yet without the cops,
whilst I have so many old clucking hens about, and hardly
an egg to be found.”</p>

<p>“You surely wouldn’t send me home empty as I came,
madam dear?”</p>

<p>“You may go home the same way you came, for you
aren’t wanted here.”</p>

<p>“Now,” croaked Joan, hoarse with passion, “as true as I
tell you so, if you don’t sell me some eggs, you will wish
your cakes dough.”</p>

<p>As the old witch said this, she perched herself on the
stile, shaking her finger and “nodling” her head.</p>

<p>Madam Noy was a bit of a virago herself, so she took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a stone and flung it at Joan; it hit her in the face, and
made her jaws rattle.</p>

<p>As soon as she recovered, she spinned forth:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Madam Noy, you ugly old bitch,</div>
<div class="verse">You shall have the gout, the palsy, and itch;</div>
<div class="verse">All the eggs your hens lay henceforth shall be addle;</div>
<div class="verse">All your hens have the pip, and die with the straddle;</div>
<div class="verse">And ere I with the mighty fine madam have done,</div>
<div class="verse">Of her favourite ‘coppies’ she shan’t possess one.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From that day forward, madam was always afflicted. The
doctor from Penzance could do little for her. The fowls’
eggs were always bad; the hens died, and madam lost
all her “coppies.” This is the way it came about—in the
place of cops the brains came out—and all by the spells
of old Joan.</p>

<p>This forms the subject of one of the old Cornish drolls,
which ran in an irregular jingle, such as the above, and was
half sung, half said by the droll-teller.</p>

<h3 id="heading66">THE WITCH OF TREVA.</h3>

<p>Once on a time, long ago, there lived at Treva, a hamlet
in Zennor, a wonderful old lady deeply skilled in necromancy.
Her charms, spells, and dark incantations made
her the terror of the neighbourhood. However, this old
lady failed to impress her husband with any belief in her
supernatural powers, nor did he fail to proclaim his unbelief
aloud.</p>

<p>One day this sceptic came home to dinner and found, being
exceedingly hungry, to his bitter disappointment, that not
only was there no dinner to eat, but that there was no meat
in the house. His rage was great, but all he could get from
his wife was, “I couldn’t get meat out of the stones, could
I?” It was in vain to give the reins to passion, the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
woman told him, and he must know “that hard words buttered
no parsnips.” Well, at length he resolved to put his
wife’s powers to the proof, and he quietly but determinedly
told her that he would be the death of her if she did not
get him some dinner; but if in half an hour she gave him
some good cooked meat, he would believe all she had boasted
of her power, and be submissive to her for ever. St Ives,
the nearest market-town, was five miles off; but nothing
doubting, the witch put on her bonnet and cloak, and started.
Her husband watched her from their cottage door, down the
hill, and at the bottom of the hill he saw his wife quietly
place herself on the ground and disappear. In her place a
fine hare ran on at its full speed.</p>

<p>He was not a little startled, but he waited, and within the
half hour in walked his wife with “good flesh and taties all
ready for aiting.” There was no longer any doubt, and the
poor husband lived in fear of the witch of Treva to the day
of her death.</p>

<p>This event took place after a few years, and it is said the
room was full of evil spirits, and that the old woman’s
skrieks were awful to hear. Howbeit, peace in the shape of
pale-faced death came to her at last, and then a black cloud
rested over the house when all the heavens were clear and
blue.</p>

<p>She was borne to the grave by six aged men, carried, as is
the custom, under hand. When they were about half way
between the house and the church, a hare started from the
roadside and leaped over the coffin. The terrified bearers
let the corpse fall to the ground, and ran away. Another
lot of men took up the coffin and proceeded. They had not
gone far when puss was suddenly seen seated on the coffin,
and again the coffin was abandoned. After long consultation,
and being persuaded by the parson to carry the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
woman very quickly into the churchyard, while he walked
before, six others made the attempt, and as the parson never
ceased to repeat the Lord’s Prayer, all went on quietly. Arrived
at the church stile, they rested the corpse, the parson
paused to commence the ordinary burial service, and there
stood the hare, which, as soon as the clergyman began “I
am the resurrection and the life,” uttered a diabolical howl,
changed into a black, unshapen creature, and disappeared.</p>

<h3 id="heading67">HOW MR LENINE GAVE UP COURTING.</h3>

<p>Mr Lenine had been, as was his wont, spending his
evening hours with the lady of his love. He was a
timid man, and always returned to Tregenebris early. Beyond
this, as the lady was alone, she deemed it prudent to
let the world know that Mr Lenine left her by daylight.</p>

<p>One evening, it was scarcely yet dark, and our lover was
returning home through Leah Lanes. His horse started at
an old woman, who had crept under the hedge for shelter
from a passing shower. As Mr Lenine saw a figure moving
in the shade he was terrified.</p>

<p>“Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho,” sang an owl.</p>

<p>“It’s only me—Mr Lenine of Tregenebris,” said he, putting
the spurs to his horse.</p>

<p>Something followed him, fast as he might go, and he
forced his horse up the hill by Leah vean.</p>

<p>“Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho,” sang the owl.</p>

<p>“It’s only me—Aunt Betty Foss,” screamed the old
woman.</p>

<p>“Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho, ho,” sang the owl again.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye be afeard, Mr Lenine,” shrieked Aunt Betty,
almost out of breath.</p>

<p>“Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho, ho, ho,” also shrieked the owl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only John Lenine of Tregenebris,” stammered
the frightened lover, who had, however, reached home.</p>

<p>He went no more a-courting. He was fully persuaded
that either a highwayman and his crew, or the devil and his
imps, were upon him. He died a bachelor, and the charming
lady became a peevish old maid, and died in solitude;
all owing to the hooting owl.</p>

<p>Some do say Betty Foss was a witch, and the owl her
familiar.</p>

<h3 id="heading68">THE WITCH AND THE TOAD.</h3>

<p>An old woman called Alsey—usually Aunt Alsey—occupied
a small cottage in Anthony, one of a row which
belonged to a tradesman living in Dock—as Devonport was
then designated, to distinguish it from Plymouth. The old
woman possessed a very violent temper, and this, more than
anything else, fixed upon her the character of being a witch.
Her landlord had frequently sought his rent, and as frequently
he received nothing but abuse. He had, on the
special occasion to which our narrative refers, crossed the
Tamar and walked to Anthony, with the firm resolve of
securing his rent, now long in arrear, and of turning the old
termagant out of the cottage. A violent scene ensued, and
the vicious old woman, more than a match for a really kind-hearted
and quiet man, remained the mistress of the situation.
She seated herself in the door of her cottage and
cursed her landlord’s wife, “the child she was carrying,” and
all belonging to him, with so devilish a spite that Mr —— owned
he was fairly driven away in terror.</p>

<p>On returning home, he, of course, told his wife all the circumstances;
and while they were discoursing on the subject,—the
whole story being attentively listened to by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
daughter, then a young girl, who is my informant,—a
woman came into the shop requiring some articles which
they sold.</p>

<p>“Sit still, father,” said Mrs —— to her husband; “you
must be tired. I will see to the shop.”</p>

<p>So she went from the parlour into the shop, and, hearing
the wants of her customer, proceeded to supply them; gossiping
gaily, as was her wont, to interest the buyer.</p>

<p>Mrs —— was weighing one of the articles required, when
something falling heavily from the ceiling of the shop,
struck the beam out of her hand, and both—the falling body
and the scales—came together with much noise on to the
counter. At the same instant both women screamed;—the
shopkeeper calling also “Father! father!”—meaning her
husband thereby—with great energy.</p>

<p>Mr —— and his daughter were in the shop instantly,
and there, on the counter, they saw an enormous and most
ugly toad sprawling amidst the chains of the scales. The
first action of the man was to run back to the parlour, seize
the tongs, and return to the shop. He grasped the swollen
toad with the tongs, the vicious creature spitting all the
time, and, without a word, he went back and flung it behind
the block of wood which was burning in the grate. The
object of terror being removed, the wife, who was shortly to
become the mother of another child, though usually a woman
who had great command over her feelings, fainted.</p>

<p>This circumstance demanding all their attention, the toad
was forgotten. The shock was a severe one; and although
Mrs —— was restored in a little time to her senses, she
again and again became faint. Those fits continuing, her
medical attendant, Dr ——, was sent for, and on his arrival
he ordered that his patient should be immediately placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
bed, and the husband was informed that he must be prepared
for a premature birth.</p>

<p>The anxiety occasioned by these circumstances, and the
desire to afford every relief to his wife, so fully occupied Mr
——, that for an hour or two he entirely forgot the cause of
all this mischief; or, perhaps satisfying himself that the toad
was burnt to ashes, he had no curiosity to look after it.
He was, however, suddenly summoned from the bedroom,
in which he was with his wife, by his daughter calling to
him, in a voice of terror,—</p>

<p>“O father, the toad, the toad!”</p>

<p>Mr —— rushed down-stairs, and he then discovered that
the toad, though severely burnt, had escaped destruction.
It must have crawled up over the log of wood, and from it
have fallen down amongst the ashes. There it was now
making useless struggles to escape, by climbing over the
fender.</p>

<p>The tongs were again put in requisition, with the intention
this time of carrying the reptile out of the house.
Before, however, he had time to do so, a man from Anthony
came hastily into the shop with the information that Aunt
Alsey had fallen into the fire, as the people supposed, in a
fit, and that she was nearly burnt to death. This man had
been sent off with two commissions—one to fetch the doctor,
and the other to bring Mr —— with him, as much of the
cottage had been injured by fire, communicated to it by the
old woman’s dress.</p>

<p>In as short a time as possible the parish surgeon and Mr
—— were at Anthony, and too truly they found the old
woman most severely burnt—so seriously, indeed, there was
no chance that one so aged could rally from the shock which
her system must have received. However, a litter was carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
prepared, the old woman was placed in it, and carried
to the workhouse. Every attention was given to her situation,
but she never recovered perfect consciousness, and
during the night she died.</p>

<p>The toad, which we left inside the fender in front of a
blazing fire, was removed from a position so trying to any
cold-blooded animal, by the servant, and thrown, with a
“hugh” and a shudder, upon one of the flower-beds in the
small garden behind the house.</p>

<p>There it lay the next morning dead, and when examined
by Mr ——, it was found that all the injuries sustained by
the toad corresponded with those received by the poor old
wretch, who had no doubt fallen a victim to passion.</p>

<p>As we have only to deal with the mysterious relation
which existed between the witch and the toad, it is not
necessary that we should attend further to the innocent
victim of an old woman’s vengeance, than to say that eventually
a babe was born—that that babe grew to be a handsome
man, was an officer in the navy, and having married,
went to sea, and perished, leaving a widow with an unborn
child to lament his loss. Whether this was a result of the
witch’s curse, those who are more deeply skilled in witchcraft
than I am may perhaps tell.</p>

<h3 id="heading69">THE SAILOR WIZARD.</h3>

<p>This appears to have been, and it may still be, a very common
superstition. I have lately received from Mr T. Q.
Couch of Bodmin the story of some sailors, who had reason
to suspect that one of their body was a wizard. This was
eventually proved to have been the case, by circumstances
in every way resembling those of our old witch. There had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
been a quarrel, and revenge had been talked of. The sailors
were all grouped together in the forepart of the ship, except
the suspected one, and a toad fell sprawling amongst them.
One of the men flung the creature into the fire in the
caboose. It struggled for a moment in the fire, and then by
a convulsive effort flung itself out. Immediately the toad
was caught up by one of the men, and flung into the sea.</p>

<p>In the course of some little time the absent sailor made
his appearance dripping wet. In a drunken frolic he had
first fallen into the fire at a low beer shop or “Kiddle-e-Wink,”
and subsequently he fell out of the boat into the sea.</p>

<h2>ROMANCES OF THE MINERS.</h2>

<h3 id="heading70">TRADITIONS OF TINNERS.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“An ancient story I’ll tell you anon,</div>
<div class="verse">Which is older by far than the days of King John;</div>
<div class="verse">But this you should know, that that red-robed sinner</div>
<div class="verse">Robbed the Jew of the gold he had made as a tinner.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right"><i>Old Cornish Song.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">There is scarcely a spot in Cornwall where tin is
at present found, that has not been worked over
by the “old men,” as the ancient miners are
always called.</p>

<p>Every valley has been “streamed”—that is, the deposits
have been washed for tin; over every hill where now a tin
mine appears, there are evidences, many of them most extensive,
of actual mining operations having been carried on
to as great a depth as was possible in the days when the
appliances of science were unknown.</p>

<p>Wherever the “streamer” has been, upon whatever spot
the old miner has worked, there we are told the “Finician”
(<i>Phœnician</i>) has been, or the Jew has mined.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>There is much confusion in these traditions. The Jew,
and the Saracen, and the Phœnician are regarded as terms
applied to the same people. Whereas the Phœnicians, who
are recorded to have traded with the Cornish Britons for tin,
and the Jews, who were the great tin miners and merchants
in the days of King John, are separated by wide periods
of time; and the “Saracens,” who some suppose to have been
miners who came from Spain when that country was under
the dominion of the Moors, occupy a very undefined position.
Tradition, however, tells us that the old Cornish miners
shipped their tin at several remarkable islands round the
coast. St Michael’s Mount has been especially noticed, but
this arises from the circumstance that it still retains the
peculiar character which it appears to have possessed when
Diodorus wrote. But Looe Island, St Nicholas’s Island in
Plymouth Sound, the island at St Ives, the Chapel Rock at
Perran, and many other insular masses of rock, which are at
but a short distance from the coast, are said to have been
shipping-places.</p>

<p>Tradition informs us that the Christian churches upon
Dartmoor, which are said to have been built about the reign
of John, were reared by the Jews. Once, and once only, I
heard the story told in more detail. They, the Jews, did not
actually work in the tin streams and mines of the Moor, but
they employed tinners, who were Christians; and the king
imposed on the Jew merchants the condition that they should
build churches for their miners.</p>

<p>That the Phœnicians came to Cornwall to buy tin has been
so often told, that there is little to be added to the story. It
was certainly new, however, to be informed by the miners in
Gwennap—that there could be no shade of doubt but that
St Paul himself came to Cornwall to buy tin, and that
Creegbraws—a mine still in existence—supplied the saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
largely with that valuable mineral. Gwennap is regarded
by Gwennap men as the centre of Christianity. This feeling
has been kept alive by the annual meeting of the Wesleyan
body in Gwennap Pit—an old mine-working—on Whit-monday.
This high estate and privilege is due, says tradition,
to the fact that St Paul himself preached in the parish.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>I have also been told that St Paul preached to the tinners
on Dartmoor, and a certain cross on the road from Plympton
to Princes-Town has been indicated as the spot upon
which the saint stood to enlighten the benighted miners of
this wild region. Of St Piran or Perran we have already
spoken as the patron saint of the tinners, and of the discovery
of tin a story has been told, (p. 21;) and we have already
intimated that another saint, whose name alone is preserved,
St Picrous, has his feast-day amongst the tinners of eastern
Cornwall, on the second Thursday before Christmas.</p>

<p>Amidst the giant stories we have the very remarkable
Jack the Tinker, who is clearly indicated as introducing the
knowledge of tin, or of the dressing of tin, to the Cornish.
This is another version of Wayland Smith, the blacksmith of
Berkshire. The blacksmith of the Berkshire legend reappears
in a slightly altered character in Jack the Tinker. In
Camden’s “Britannia” we read, relative to Ashdown, in
Berkshire:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The burial-place of Baereg, the Danish chief, who was slain in this
fight, (the fight between Alfred and the Danes,) is distinguished by
a parcel of stones, less than a mile from the hill, set on edge, enclosing
a piece of ground somewhat raised. On the east side of the southern
extremity stand three squarish flat stones, of about four or five feet over
either way, supporting a fourth, and now called by the vulgar, Wayland
Smith, from an idle tradition about an invisible smith replacing lost horseshoes
there.”—<i>Gough’s Camden</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>See “Kenilworth,” by Sir Walter Scott, who has appropriated Wayland
Smith with excellent effect.</p>

<p>“The Berkshire legend of Wayland Smith (‘Wayland Smith,’ by W. S.
Singer) is probably but a prototype of Dædalus, Tubal Cain, &amp;c.”—<i>Wilson’s
Prehistoric Annals of Scotland.</i></p>

<p>The existence of the terms “Jews’ houses,” “Jews’ tin,”
“Jews’ leavings,” or “atall,” and “atall Saracen,” prove the
connexion of strangers with the Cornish tin mines. The inquiry
is too large to be entered on here. I reserve it for another
and more fitting place. I may, however, remark in
passing, that I have no doubt the Romans were active
miners during the period of their possession; and many relics
which have been found and ascribed to the Britons are undoubtedly
Roman. See further remarks on p. 118, “Who are
the Knockers?”</p>

<p>Mr Edmonds supposes that he found in a bronze vessel
discovered near Marazion a caldron in which tin was refined.
In the first place, a bronze vessel would never have
been used for that purpose—chemical laws are against it;
and in the second place, it is more than doubtful if ever the
“Jews’ tin” was subjected to this process. In all probability,
the bronze vessel discovered was a “Roman camp-kettle.”
A very full description of bronze caldrons of this description
will be found in “The Archæology and Prehistoric Annals
of Scotland,” by Daniel Wilson, p. 274.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to insert here the tradition of
a very important application of this metal.</p>

<p>The use of tin as a mordant, for which very large quantities
are now used, is said to have been thus discovered:—</p>

<p>Mr Crutchy, Bankside, married a Scotchwoman. This
lady often told her husband that his scarlet was not equal to
one she could dye. He set her to work. She dyed a skein
of worsted in a saucepan, using the same material as her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
husband, but produced a better colour. She did not know
this was owing to the saucepan’s being tinned, but he detected
the fact, and made his fortune as a dyer of scarlet and Turkey-red.
The most important Turkey-red dye-works are even
now in the neighbourhood of Lochlomond; therefore, this
Scotchwoman may have been better acquainted with the
process than the story tells.</p>

<h3 id="heading71">THE TINNER OF CHYANNOR.</h3>

<p>The village of Trereen, near the Logan Stone, was at one
time an important market-town. Here came all the
tin-streamers who worked from Penberth to the hills, and
to protect the place and the valuable property which was
accumulated here, Castle Trereen was built. Here came—or
rather into the cove near it came—the Tyrian merchants.
They were not allowed to advance beyond the shores, lest
they should discover the country from which the tin was
brought. But it is not of them that we have now to tell,
but of a knot of tinners who came from the low country
between Chyannor and Trengothal. These were assembled
round the Garrack Zans, which then stood in the centre of
the market-place of Trereen. Times had been bad, and they
were consulting together what they had better do. The
“streams” had failed them, and they believed all the tin was
worked out. Some of them had heard that there was tin in
“the country a long way off,” some miles beyond Market-Jew;
but they had but a very dim idea of the place or of
the people. One of them, who, though an old man, was
more adventurous than any of his comrades, said he would
travel there and see what could be done. It was then determined
that Tom Trezidder should try his fortune, and the
others would wait until he came home again, or sent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
them to come to him. This was soon noised about, and all
the women, old and young, came to say “Good-bye” to Tom.
His parting with his wife was brief but bitter. He bore up
well, and with a stout heart started on his adventure. Tom
Trezidder arrived at length at a place not far from Goldsythney,
and here he found one of the Jew merchants, who
farmed the tin ground, and sold the tin at St Michael’s
Mount; and the Jew was very anxious to engage so experienced
a “streamer” as Tom was. Tom, nothing loath,
took service for a year. He was to have just enough to live
on, and a share of profits at the year’s end. Tom worked
diligently, and plenty of tin was the result of his experienced
labour. The year expired, and Tom looked for his share of
the profits. The Jew contrived to put Tom off, and promised
Tom great things if he would stop for another year,
and persuaded him to send for some of his old comrades,
clenching every argument which he employed with a small
piece of advice, “Never leave an old road for a new one.”</p>

<p>The other tinners were shy of venturing so far, so that
two or three only could be persuaded to leave the West
Country. With Tom and with his brethren the year passed
by, and at the end he got no money, but only the same
piece of advice, “Never leave an old road for a new one.”
This went on for a third year, when all of them, being naturally
tired of this sort of thing, resolved to go home again.</p>

<p>Tom Trezidder was a favourite with his master, and was
greatly esteemed for his honesty and industry by his mistress.</p>

<p>When they left she gave Tom a good currant cake to take
home to his old woman, and told him to remember the advice,
“Never leave an old road for a new one.”</p>

<p>The tinners trudged on together until they were on the
western side of Penzance. They were weary, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
found that since they had left home a new road had been
made over the hills, which saved them a considerable distance—in
fact it was a “short cut.” On they went. “No,”
says Tom; “never leave an old road for a new one.” They
all laughed at him, and trudged on. But Tom kept in the
old road along the valley round the hill. When Tom reached
the other end of the “short cut” he thought he would rest a
bit, and he sat down by the roadside and ate his <i>fuggan</i>.
This his mistress had given him, that he might not break
his cake until he got home.</p>

<p>He had not sat long when he heard a noise, and, looking
up the hill, he saw his comrades, whom he thought were
miles in advance of him, slowly and sorrowfully descending
it. They came at last to where Tom was seated, and a sad
tale had they to tell. They had scarcely got into the new
road when they were set upon by robbers, who took from
them “all their little bit of money,” and then beat them
because they had no more.</p>

<p>Tom, you may be sure, thought the piece of advice worth
something now, as it had saved his bacon.</p>

<p>Tom arrived home at last, and glad was the old woman to
see her old man once again; so she made him some “herby
tea” at once. He shewed his wife the cake, and told her that
all he had received for his share of profits was the piece of
advice already given.</p>

<p>The ladies who read this story will understand how vexed
was Tom’s wife,—there are but few of them who would not
have done as she did, that was to seize the cake from the
table and fling it at her husband’s head, calling him an old
fool. Tom Trezidder stooped to avoid the blow. Slap
against the corner of the dresser went the cake, breaking in
pieces with the blow, and out on the lime-ash floor rolled a
lot of gold coins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>This soon changed the aspect of things; the storm rolled
back, and sunshine was once more in the cottage. The coins
were all gathered up, and they found a scrap of paper, on
which, when they got the priest to read it, they discovered
was written an exact account of each year’s profits, and Tom’s
share. The three years’ shares had been duly hoarded for
him by his master and mistress; and now this old couple
found they had enough to make them comfortable for the
rest of their days. Many were the prayers said by Tom and
his wife for the happiness and health of the honest Jew tin
merchant and his wife.</p>

<h3 id="heading72">“WHO ARE THE KNOCKERS?”</h3>

<p>Charles Kingsley in his “Yeast: a Problem,” asks
this question—Tregarra answers,—</p>

<p>“They are <i>the ghosts</i>, the miners hold, <i>of the old Jews
that crucified our Lord, and were sent for slaves by the
Roman emperors to work the mines</i>: and we find their
old smelting-houses, which we call <i>Jews’ houses</i>, and their
blocks at the bottom of the great bogs, which we call <i>Jews’
tin</i>: and then a town among us too, which we call <i>Market-Jew</i>,
but the old name was Marazion, that means the bitterness
of Zion, they tell me; and bitter work it was for them,
no doubt, poor souls! We used to break into old shafts and
adits which they had made, and find fine old stag’s-horn
pickaxes, that crumbled to pieces when we brought them to
grass. And they say that if a man will listen of a still
night about these shafts, he may hear the ghosts of them
at work, knocking and picking, as clear as if there was a
man at work in the next level.”</p>

<p>In <i>Notes and Queries</i> will be found some learned discussions
on the question of the Jews working the Cornish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tin mines, as though it were merely one of tradition. That
the Jews farmed the tin mines of Cornwall and Devonshire
is an historical fact, of which we have evidence in charters
granted by several of our kings, especially by King John.
Carew in his “Survey of Cornwall” gives some account of
their mode of dealing with the tinners. Hence the terms
“Jews’ houses,” given to old and rude smelting-works,—many
of which I have seen,—and hence the name of “Jews’ tin,”
given to the old blocks of tin, specimens of which may be
seen in the <i>Museum of Practical Geology</i>, and in the
museum of the <i>Royal Institution of Cornwall</i>, at Truro.
“<i>Atall Sarazin</i>” is another term applied to some of the old
waste-heaps of the ancient tin mines.</p>

<p>“The Jews,” says Whitaker, (“Origin of Arianism,” p. 334,)
“denominated themselves, and were denominated by the Britons
of Cornwall, <i>Saracens</i>, as the genuine progeny of Sarah.”
Be this as it may, I have often heard in the mining villages—from
twenty to thirty years since—a man coming from a
distant parish, called “<i>a foreigner</i>;” a man from a distant
country, termed “<i>an outlandish man</i>;” and any one not
British born, designated as “<i>a Saracen</i>.”</p>

<p>But this has led me away from the knockers, who are in
some districts called also “<i>the buccas</i>.” Many a time have
I been seriously informed by the miners themselves that
these sprites have been heard working away in the remote
parts of a lode, repeating the blows of the miner’s pick or
sledge with great precision. Generally speaking, the
knockers work upon productive lodes only; and they have
often kindly indicated to the trusting miner, where they
might take good tribute pitches.</p>

<p>To Wesley, Cornwall owes a deep debt. He found the
country steeped in the darkness of superstitious ignorance,
and he opened a new light upon it. Associated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
spread of Wesleyan Methodism, has been the establishment
of schools; and under the influence of religion and education,
many of the superstitions have faded away. We rarely hear
of the knockers now; but the following occurrence will shew
that the knockers have not entirely left the land:—</p>

<p>One Saturday night I had retired to rest, having first seen
that all the members of the household had gone to their
bedrooms. These were my daughters, two female servants,
and an old woman, named Mary, who was left, by the proprietor,
in charge of the house which I occupied.</p>

<p>I had been some time in bed, when I distinctly heard a
bedroom door open, and footsteps which, after moving about
for some time in the passage or landing, from which the
bedrooms opened, slowly and carefully descended the stairs.
I heard a movement in the kitchen below, and the footsteps
again ascended the stairs, and went into one of the bedrooms.
This noise continued so long, and was so regularly repeated,
that I began to fear lest one of the children were taken
suddenly ill. Yet I felt assured, if it was so, one of the
servants would call me. Therefore I lay still and listened
until I fell asleep.</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning, when I descended to the breakfast-room,
I asked the eldest of the two servants what had
occasioned so much going up and down stairs in the night.
She declared that no one had left their bedrooms after they
had retired to them. I then inquired of the younger girl,
and of each of my daughters as they made their appearance.
No one had left their rooms—they had not heard any noises.
My youngest daughter, who had been, after this inquiry of
mine, for some minutes alone with the youngest servant,
came laughing to me,—</p>

<p>“Papa, Nanny says the house is haunted, and that they
have often heard strange noises in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>So I called Nancy; but all I could learn from her was
that noises, like that of men going up and down stairs,—of
threshing corn, and of “beating the borer,” (a mining operation,)
were not uncommon.</p>

<p>We all laughed over papa’s ghost during the breakfast,
and by and by old Mary made her appearance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “it is quite true, as Nanny as a told you.
I have often heard all sorts of strange noises; but I b’lieve
they all come from the lode of tin which runs under the
house. <i>Wherever there is a lode of tin, you are sure to
hear strange noises.</i>”</p>

<p>“What, Mary! was it the knockers I heard last
night?”</p>

<p>“Yes; ’twas the knackers, down working upon the tin—no
doubt of it.”</p>

<p>This was followed by a long explanation, and numerous
stories of mines in the Lelant and St Ives district, in which
the knockers had been often heard.</p>

<p>After a little time, Mary, imagining, I suppose, that the
young ladies might not like to sleep in a house beneath
which the knockers were at work; again came with her usual
low courtesy into the parlour.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” says she; “but none of the young
ladies need be afraid. There are no spirits in the house; it
is very nearly a new one, and no one has ever died in the
house.”</p>

<p>This makes a distinct difference between the ghost of the
departed and those gnomes who are doomed to toil in the
earth’s dark recesses.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The Cornish knocker does not appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to be the “<i>cobal</i>” of German miners. The former are generally
kindly, and often serve the industrious miner; the latter
class are always malicious, and, I believe, are never heard
but when mischief is near.</p>

<h3 id="heading73">MINERS’ SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>

<p>Miners say they often see little imps or demons underground.
Their presence is considered favourable;
they indicate the presence of lodes, about which they work
during the absence of the miners. A miner told my informant
that he had often seen them, sitting on pieces of
timber, or tumbling about in curious attitudes, when he
came to work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Miners do not like the form of the cross being made
underground. A friend of my informant, going through
some “levels” or “adits,” made a + by the side of one, to
know his way back, as he would have to return by himself.
He was compelled to alter it into another form.</p>

<p>If miners see a snail when going to “bal” in the morning,
they always drop a piece of tallow from their candles by
its side.</p>

<h3 id="heading74">CHRISTMAS-EVE IN THE MINES.</h3>

<p>On Christmas-eve, in former days, the small people, or the
spriggans, would meet at the bottom of the deepest
mines, and have a midnight mass. Then those who were in
the mine would hear voices melodious beyond all earthly
voices, singing, “Now well! now well;”<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and the strains
of some deep-toned organ would shake the rocks. Of the
grandeur of those meetings, old stories could not find words
sufficiently sonorous to speak; it was therefore left to the
imagination. But this was certain, the temple formed by
the fairy bands in which to celebrate the eve of the birth of
a Saviour, in whose mercy they all had hope, was of the most
magnificent description.</p>

<p>Midsummer-eve and new-year’s day and eve are holidays
with the miners. It has been said they refuse to work on
those days from superstitious reasons. I never heard of
any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading75">WARNINGS AND “TOKENS.”</h3>

<p>Amongst the mining population there is a deeply-rooted
belief in warnings. The following, related by
a very respectable man, formerly a miner, well illustrates
this:—</p>

<p>“My father, when a lad, worked with a companion (James
or ‘Jim,’ as he was called) in Germo. They lived close by
Old Wheal Grey in Breage. One evening, the daughter of
the person with whom they lodged came in to her mother,
crying, ‘Billy and Jim ben out theer for more than a hour,
and I ben chasin them among the Kilyur banks, and they
waan’t ler me catch them. As fast as I do go to one, they
do go to another.’ ‘Hould your tongue, child,’ said the
mother; ‘’twas their forenoon core, and they both ben up
in bed this hours.’ ‘I’m sure I ben chasin them,’ said the
girl. The mother then went up-stairs and awoke the lads,
telling them the story. One of them said, ‘’Tis a warning;
somethin will happen in un old end, and I shan’t go to
mine this core.’ ‘Nonsense,’ said the other; ‘don’t let us
be so foolish; the child has been playing with some strangers,
and it isn’t worth while to be spaled for any such foolishness.’
‘I tell you,’ replied the other, ‘I won’t go.’ As it
was useless for one man to go alone, both remained away.
In the course of the night, however, a run took place in the
end they were working in, and tens of thousands of kibblefuls
came away. Had they been at work, it was scarcely
possible for them to have escaped.”</p>

<p>At Wheal Vor it has always been and is now believed
that a fatal accident in the mine is presaged by the appearance
of a hare or white rabbit in one of the engine-houses.
The men solemnly declare that they have chased these appearances
till they were hemmed in apparently, without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
able to catch them. The white rabbit on one occasion being
<i>run into a “windbore”</i> lying on the ground, <i>and, though
stopped in</i>, escaped.</p>

<p>In this mine there appears to be a general belief among
the men in “tokens” and supernatural appearances. A few
months since, a fine old man reported, on being relieved
from his turn as watcher, that during the night he heard a
loud sound like the emptying of a cartload of rubbish in
front of the account-house, where he was staying. On going
out, nothing was to be seen. The poor fellow, considering
the strange sound as a “warning,” pined away and died
within a few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="heading76">THE GHOST ON HORSEBACK.</h3>

<p>Billy —— and John ——, working at Wheal Vor, were
in the habit, early in the morning, of calling out a dog
or two, kept by the occupier of an adjoining farm, and with
them hunt over the Godolphin warren adjoining. One morning,
while thus engaged, one of them gave the alarm that a
man on horseback was coming down the road. “’Tisn’t
possible,” said the other; “no horse can ever come over that
road.” “There is a horse, and old Cap’n T. is upon it,”
replied the first. “Hold thy tongue,” rejoined his comrade;
“he’s dead months ago.” “I know that; but ’tis he, sure
enough.” Both crouched down behind a bush; and my informant,
whose father was one of the parties, declared that
the appearance of Capt. T., on a black horse, passed noiselessly
down the road immediately before them, but without
noticing their presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading77">THE BLACK DOGS.</h3>

<p>About thirty years since, a man and a lad were engaged
in sinking a shaft at Wheal Vor Mine, when the lad,
through carelessness or accident, missed in charging a hole,
so that a necessity arose for the dangerous operation of
picking out the charge. This they proceeded to do, the man
severely reprimanding the carelessness of his assistant. Several
other miners at the time being about to change their
core, were on the plat above, calling down and conversing
occasionally with man and boy. Suddenly the charge exploded,
and the latter were seen to be thrown up in the
midst of a volume of flame. As soon as help could be procured,
a party descended, when the remains of the poor fellows
were found to be shattered and scorched beyond recognition.
When these were brought to the surface, the clothes
and a mass of mangled flesh dropped from the bodies. A bystander,
to spare the feelings of the relatives, hastily caught
up the revolting mass in a shovel, and threw the whole into
the blazing furnace of Woolf’s engine, close at hand. From
that time the enginemen declared that troops of little black
dogs continually haunted the place, even when the doors were
shut. Few of them liked to talk about it; but it was difficult
to obtain the necessary attendance to work the machine.</p>

<h3 id="heading78">PITMEN’S OMENS AND GOBLINS.</h3>

<p>It is curious to notice the correspondence between the
superstitions of the coal-miner and those employed in
the metalliferous mines. The following comes very opportunely
to our hand:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The superstitions of pitmen were once many and terrible; but so far
from existing now-a-days, they are only matters of tradition among the
old men. One class only of superstitions does exist among a few of
the older and less-educated pitmen—namely, the class of omens, warnings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and signs. If one of these pitmen meet or see a woman, if he catch but a
glimpse of her draperies, on his way, in the middle of the night to the pit,
the probability is that he returns home and goes to bed again. The appearance
of woman at this untimely hour has often materially impeded the
day’s winning, for the omen is held not to be personal to the individual
perceiving it, but to bode general ill luck to all. The walk from home to
pit mouth, always performed at dead of the night, was the period when
omens were mostly to be looked for. The supernatural appearance of a
little white animal like a rabbit, which was said to cross the miner’s path,
was another warning not to descend. Sometimes the omens were rather
mental than visual. The pitmen in the midland counties have, or had, a
belief, unknown in the north, in aerial whistlings, warning them against the
pit. Who, or what the invisible musicians were, nobody pretended to
know; but for all that, they must have been counted and found to consist
of seven, as “The Seven Whistlers” is the name they bear to this day.
Two goblins were believed to haunt the northern mines. One was a spiteful
elf, who indicated his presence only by the mischief he perpetrated. He
rejoiced in the name of “Cutty Soams,” and appears to have employed
himself only in the stupid device of severing the rope-traces or soams, by
which an assistant-putter—honoured by the title of “the fool”—is yoked to
the tub. The strands of hemp which were left all sound in the board at
“kenner-time,” were found next morning severed in twain. “Cutty
Soams” has been at work, would the fool and his driver say, dolefully
knotting the cord. The other goblin was altogether a more sensible, and,
indeed, an honest and hard-working bogie, much akin to the Scotch brownie,
or the hairy fiend, whom Milton rather scurvily apostrophises as a lubber.
The supernatural personage in question was no other than a ghostly putter,
and his name was “Bluecap.” Sometimes the miners would perceive a
light blue flame flicker through the air, and settle on a full coal-tub, which
immediately moved towards the rolley-way, as though impelled by the
sturdiest sinews in the working. Industrious Bluecap was at his vocation;
but he required, and rightly, to be paid for his services, which he
modestly rated as those of an ordinary average putter; therefore once a
fortnight Bluecap’s wages were left for him in a solitary corner of the
mine. If they were a farthing below his due, the indignant Bluecap
would not pocket a stiver; if they were a farthing above his due, indignant
Bluecap left the surplus revenue where he found it. The writer asked
his informant, a hewer, whether, if Bluecap’s wages were now-a-days to be
left for him, he thought they would be appropriated; the man shrewdly
answered, he thought they would be taken by Bluecap, or by somebody
else. Of the above notions it must be understood that the idea of omens
is the only one still seriously entertained, and even its hold upon the popular
mind, as has been before stated, is becoming weaker and weaker.—<i>Colliery
Guardian, May 23, 1863.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading79">THE DEAD HAND.</h3>

<p>“I’ve seen it—I’ve seen it!” exclaimed a young woman,
pale with terror, approaching with much haste the
door of a cottage, around which were gathered several of the
miners’ wives inhabiting the adjoining dwellings.</p>

<p>“God’s mercy be with the chield!” replied the oldest
woman of the group, with very great seriousness.</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice,” asked one of the youngest women, “and
do ’e b’lieve any harm will come o’ seeing it?”</p>

<p>“Mary Doble saw it and pined; Jinny Trestrail was
never the same woman after she seed the hand in Wheal
Jewel; and I knows ever so many more; but let us hope,
by the blessing o’ the Lord, no evil will come on Mary.”</p>

<p>Mary was evidently impressed with a sense of some heavy
trouble. She sighed deeply, and pressed her hand to her
side, as if to still the beating of her heart. The thoughtless
faith of the old woman promised to work out a fulfilment of
her fears in producing mental distress and corporeal suffering
in the younger one.</p>

<p>While this was passing in the little village, a group of men
were gathered around a deserted shaft, which existed in too
dangerous proximity with the abodes of the miners. They
were earnestly discussing the question of the reality of the
appearance of the <i>dead hand</i>—those who had not seen it
expressing a doubt of its reality, while others declared most
emphatically, “that in that very shaft they had seed un with
a lighted candle in his hand, moving up and down upon the
ladders, as though he was carried by a living man.”</p>

<p>It appears that some time previously to the abandonment
of the mine, an unfortunate miner was ascending from his
subterranean labours, carrying his candle in his hand. He
was probably seized with giddiness, but from that or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
other cause, he fell away from the ladders, and was found by
his comrades a bleeding corpse at the bottom. The character
of this man was not of the best; and after his burial, it
was stated by the people that <i>he had been seen</i>. From a
vague rumour of his spectral appearance on the surface, the
tale eventually settled itself into that of the dead hand moving
up and down in the shaft.</p>

<p>By the spectral light of the candle, the hand had been distinctly
visible to many, and the irregular motion of the light
proved that the candle was held in the usual manner between
the thumb and finger in its ball of clay, while the fingers were
employed in grasping stave after stave of the ladder. The
belief in the evil attendant on being unfortunate enough to
see this spectral hand, prevailed very generally amongst the
mining population about twenty years since. The dead hand
was not, however, confined to one shaft or mine. Similar
narrations have been met with in several districts.</p>

<h3 id="heading80">DORCAS, THE SPIRIT OF POLBREEN MINE.</h3>

<p>Polbreen Mine is situated at the foot of the hill
known as St Agnes Becon. In one of the small cottages
which immediately adjoins the mine once lived a
woman called Dorcas.</p>

<p>Beyond this we know little of her life; but we are concerned
chiefly with her death, which we are told was suicidal.</p>

<p>From some cause, which is not related, Dorcas grew weary
of life, and one unholy night she left her house and flung
herself into one of the deep shafts of Polbreen Mine, at the
bottom of which her dead and broken body was discovered.
The remnant of humanity was brought to the surface; and
after the laws of the time with regard to suicides had been
fulfilled, the body of Dorcas was buried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Her presence, however, still remained in the mine. She
appears ordinarily to take a malicious delight in tormenting
the industrious miner, calling him by name, and alluring him
from his tasks. This was carried on by her to such an extent,
that when a “tributer” had made a poor month, he was
asked if he had “been chasing Dorcas.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Dorcas was usually only a voice. It has been said by
some that they have seen her in the mine, but this is doubted
by the miners generally, who refer the spectral appearance
to the fears of their “comrade.”</p>

<p>But it is stated as an incontrovertible fact, that more than
one man who has met the spirit in the levels of the mine has
had his clothes torn off his back; whether in anger or in
sport, is not clearly made out. On one occasion, and on one
occasion only, Dorcas appears to have acted kindly. Two
miners, who for distinction’s sake we will call Martin and
Jacky, were at work in their end, and at the time busily at
work “beating the borer.”</p>

<p>The name of Jacky was distinctly uttered between the
blows. He stopped and listened—all was still. They proceed
with their task: a blow on the iron rod.—“Jacky.”
Another blow.—“Jacky.” They pause—all is silent. “Well,
thee wert called, Jacky,” said Martin, “go and see.”</p>

<p>Jacky was, however, either afraid, or he thought himself
the fool of his senses.</p>

<p>Work was resumed, and “Jacky! Jacky! Jacky!” was
called more vehemently and distinctly than before.</p>

<p>Jacky threw down his heavy hammer, and went from his
companion, resolved to satisfy himself as to the caller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not proceeded many yards from the spot on which
he had been standing at work, when a mass of rock fell from
the roof of the level, weighing many tons, which would have
crushed him to death. Martin had been stooping, holding
the borer, and a projecting corner of rock just above him
turned off the falling mass. He was securely enclosed, and
they had to dig him out, but he escaped without injury.
Jacky declared to his dying day that he owed his life to
Dorcas.</p>

<p>Although Dorcas’s shaft remains a part of Polbreen Mine,
I am informed by the present agent that her presence has
departed.</p>

<p>It may be worthy of consideration whether we have not
evidence in this distich of the extent to which mining
operations were carried on over this moorland and the adjoining
country by the ancient Cornish miners.</p>

<p>It is said that this moorland was originally Hengiston; and
tradition affirms that the name preserves the memory of a
severe contest, when the Welsh joined Egbright, a king of
the West Saxons, and defeated the host of Danes, who had
come over to “West Wales,” meaning thereby Cornwall. On
this waste Hengist had his fenced camp, and here the Cornish
and the Welsh attacked and entirely overthrew him. It is
evident, if tradition is to be believed, that the struggle was
to gain possession of a valuable tin ground.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I prefer giving this story in the words in which
it was communicated. For its singular character,
it is a ghost story well worth preserving:—“Just
seventeen years since, I went down on
the wharf from my house one night about twelve and one in
the morning, to see whether there was any ‘hobble,’ and found
a sloop, the <i>Sally</i> of St Ives, (the <i>Sally</i> was wrecked at St
Ives one Saturday afternoon in the spring of 1862,) in the
bay, bound for Hayle. When I got by the White Hart
public-house, I saw a man leaning against a post on the
wharf,—I spoke to him, wished him good morning, and
asked him what o’clock it was, but to no purpose. I was
not to be easily frightened, for I didn’t believe in ghosts;
and finding I got no answer to my repeated inquiries, I
approached close to him and said, ‘Thee’rt a queer sort of
fellow, not to speak; I’d speak to the devil, if he were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
speak to me. Who art a at all? thee’st needn’t think to
frighten me; that thee wasn’t do, if thou wert twice so ugly;
who art a at all?’ He turned his great ugly face on me,
glared abroad his great eyes, opened his mouth, and it was a
mouth sure nuff. Then I saw pieces of sea-weed and bits of
sticks in his whiskers; the flesh of his face and hands were
parboiled, just like a woman’s hands after a good day’s
washing. Well, I did not like his looks a bit, and sheered
off; but he followed close by my side, and I could hear the
water squashing in his shoes every step he took. Well, I
stopped a bit, and thought to be a little bit civil to him, and
spoke to him again, but no answer. I then thought I would
go to seek for another of our crew, and nock him up to get
the vessel, and had got about fifty or sixty yards, when I
turned to see if he was following me, but saw him where I
left him. Fearing he would come after me, I ran for my
life the few steps that I had to go. But when I got to the
door, to my horror there stood the man in the door grinning
horribly. I shook like as aspen-leaf; my hat lifted from my
head; the sweat boiled out of me. What to do I didn’t
know, and in the house there was such a row, as if everybody
was breaking up everything. After a bit I went in, for the
door was ‘on the latch,’—that is, not locked,—and called the
captain of the boat, and got light, but everything was all
right, nor had he heard any noise. We went out aboard of
the <i>Sally</i>, and I put her into Hayle, but I felt ill enough to
be in bed. I left the vessel to come home as soon as I could,
but it took me four hours to walk two miles, and I had to
lie down in the road, and was carried home to St Ives in a
cart; as far as the Terrace from there I was carried home by
my brothers, and put to bed. Three days afterwards all my
hair fell off as if I had had my head shaved. The roots,
and for about half an inch from the roots, being quite white.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
I was ill six months, and the doctor’s bill was £4, 17s. 6d. for
attendance and medicine. So you see I have reason to believe
in the existence of spirits as much as Mr Wesley had.
My hair grew again, and twelve months after I had as good
a head of dark-brown hair as ever.”<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading83">THE PHANTOM SHIP.</h3>

<p>Years long ago, one night, a gig’s crew was called to go
off to a “hobble,” to the westwards of St Ives Head.
No sooner was one boat launched than several others were put
off from the shore, and a stiff chase was maintained, each
one being eager to get to the ship, as she had the appearance
of a foreign trader. The hull was clearly visible, she was a
schooner-rigged vessel, with a light over her bows.</p>

<p>Away they pulled, and the boat which had been first
launched still kept ahead by dint of mechanical power and
skill. All the men had thrown off their jackets to row with
more freedom. At length the helmsman cried out, “Stand
ready to board her.” The sailor rowing the bow oar slipped
it out of the row-lock, and stood on the forethought, taking
his jacket on his arm, ready to spring aboard.</p>

<p>The vessel came so close to the boat that they could see
the men, and the bow-oar man made a grasp at her bulwarks.
His hand found nothing solid, and he fell, being
caught by one of his mates, back into the boat, instead of
into the water. Then ship and lights disappeared. The
next morning the <i>Neptune</i> of London, Captain Richard
Grant, was wrecked at Gwithian, and all perished. The
captain’s body was picked up after a few days, and that of
his son also. They were both buried in Gwithian churchyard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading84">JACK HARRY’S LIGHTS.</h3>

<p>The phantom lights are called, they tell me, “Jack
Harry’s lights,” because he was the first man who
was fooled by them. They are generally observed before a
gale, and the ship seen is like the ship which is sure to be
wrecked. The man who communicated this to me said,
“What or how it is we can’t tell, but the fact of its being
seen is too plain.”</p>

<p>The following is another version, which I received from
an old pilot:—</p>

<p>“Some five years ago, on a Sunday night, the wind being
strong, our crew heard of a large vessel in the offing, after
we came out of chapel. We manned our big boat, the
<i>Ark</i>,—she was nearly new then,—and away we went, under
close-reefed foresail and little mizen, the sea going over us at
a sweet rate. The vessel stood just off the head, the wind
blowing W.N.W. We had gone off four or five miles, and
we thought we were up alongside, when, lo! she slipped to
windward a league or more. Well, off we went after her,
and a good beating match we had, too; but the <i>Ark</i> was
a safe craft, and we neared and neared till, as we thought,
we got up close. Away she whizzed in a minute, in along
to Godrevy, just over the course we sailed; so we gave it up
for “Jack Harry’s light,” and, with wet jackets and disappointed
hopes, we bore up for the harbour, prepared to hear
of squalls, which came heavier than ever next day.</p>

<p>“Scores of pilots have seen and been led a nice chase after
them. They are just the same as the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>,
seen off the Cape of Good Hope.”</p>

<p>Another man informed me that, once coming down channel,
they had a phantom ship alongside of them for miles: it was
a moonlight night, with a thin rain and mist. They could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
see several men aboard moving about. They hailed her
several times, but could not get an answer, “and we didn’t
know what to think of her, when all at once she vanished.”</p>

<h3 id="heading85">THE PIRATE-WRECKER AND THE DEATH SHIP.</h3>

<p>One lovely evening in the autumn, a strange ship was seen
at a short distance from Cape Cornwall. The little
wind there was blew from the land, but she did not avail
herself of it. She was evidently permitted to drift with the
tide, which was flowing southward, and curving in round
Whitesand Bay towards the Land’s-End. The vessel, from
her peculiar rig, created no small amount of alarm amongst
the fishermen, since it told them that she was manned by
pirates; and a large body of men and women watched her
movements from behind the rocks at Caraglose. At length,
when within a couple of pistol-shots off the shore, a boat was
lowered and manned. Then a man, whose limited movements
shew him to be heavily ironed, was brought to the
side of the ship and evidently forced,—for several pistols were
held at his head,—into the boat, which then rowed rapidly to
the shore in Priest’s Cove. The waves of the Atlantic Ocean
fell so gently on the strand, that there was no difficulty in
beaching the boat. The prisoner was made to stand up, and
his ponderous chains were removed from his arms and ankles.
In a frenzy of passion he attacked the sailors, but they were
too many and too strong for him, and the fight terminated
by his being thrown into the water, and left to scramble up
on the dry sands. They pushed the boat off with a wild
shout, and this man stood uttering fearful imprecations on
his former comrades.</p>

<p>It subsequently became known that this man was so monstrously
wicked that even the pirates would no longer endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
him, and hence they had recourse to this means of ridding
themselves of him.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to tell how this wretch settled himself
at Tregaseal, and lived by a system of wrecking, pursued with
unheard-of cruelties and cunning. “It’s too frightful to
tell,” says my correspondent, “what was said about his
doings. We scarcely believed half of the vile things we
heard, till we saw what took place at his death. But one
can’t say he died, because he was taken off bodily. We shall
never know the scores, perhaps hundreds, of ships that old
sinner has brought on the cliffs, by fastening his lantern to
the neck of his horse, with its head tied close to the forefoot.
The horse, when driven along the cliff, would, by its motion,
cause the lantern to be taken for the stern-light of a ship;
then the vessel would come right in on the rocks, since those
on board would expect to find plenty of sea-room; and, if any
of the poor sailors escaped a watery grave, the old wretch
would give them a worse death, by knocking them on the
head with his hatchet, or cutting off their hands as they tried
to grasp the ledges of the rocks.”</p>

<p>A life of extreme wickedness was at length closed with
circumstances of unusual terror—so terrible, that the story
is told with feelings of awe even at the present day. The
old wretch fought lustily with death, but at length the time
of his departure came. It was in the time of the barley-harvest.
Two men were in a field on the cliff, a little below
the house, mowing. A universal calm prevailed, and there
was not a breath of wind to stir the corn. Suddenly a
breeze passed by them, and they heard the words, “The
time is come, but the man isn’t come.” These words appeared
to float in the breeze from the sea, and consequently
it attracted their attention. Looking out to sea, they saw a
black, heavy, square-rigged ship, with all her sails set, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in against wind and tide, and not a hand to be seen on board.
The sky became black as night around the ship, and as she
came under the cliff—and she came so close that the top of
the masts could scarcely be perceived—the darkness resolved
itself into a lurid storm-cloud, which extended high into the
air. The sun shone brilliantly over the country, except on
the house of the pirate at Tregaseal—that was wrapt in the
deep shadow of the cloud.</p>

<p>The men, in terror, left their work; they found all the
neighbours gathered around the door of the pirate’s cottage,
none of them daring to enter it. Parson —— had been
sent for by the terrified peasants, this divine being celebrated
for his power of driving away evil spirits.</p>

<p>The dying wrecker was in a state of agony, crying out, in
tones of the most intense terror, “The devil is tearing at me
with nails like the claws of a hawk! Put out the sailors
with their bloody hands!” and using, in the paroxysms of
pain, the most profane imprecations. The parson, the doctor,
and two of the bravest of the fishermen, were the only persons
in the room. They related that at one moment the
room was as dark as the grave, and that at the next it was
so light that every hair on the old man’s head could be seen
standing on end. The parson used all his influence to dispel
the evil spirit. His powers were so potent that he
reduced the devil to the size of a fly, but he could not put
him out of the room. All this time the room appeared as
if filled with the sea, with the waves surging violently to
and fro, and one could hear the breakers roaring, as if standing
on the edge of the cliff in a storm. At last there was
a fearful crash of thunder, and a blaze of the intensest lightning.
The house appeared on fire, and the ground shook,
as if with an earthquake. All rushed in terror from the
house, leaving the dying man to his fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The storm raged with fearful violence, but appeared to
contract its dimensions. The black cloud, which was first
seen to come in with the black ship, was moving, with a
violent internal motion, over the wrecker’s house. The
cloud rolled together, smaller and smaller, and suddenly,
with the blast of a whirlwind, it passed from Tregaseal to
the ship, and she was impelled, amidst the flashes of lightning
and roarings of thunder, away over the sea.</p>

<p>The dead body of the pirate-wrecker lay a ghastly spectacle,
with eyes expanded and the mouth partly open, still
retaining the aspect of his last mortal terror. As every one
hated him, they all desired to remove his corpse as rapidly
as possible from the sight of man. A rude coffin was
rapidly prepared, and the body was carefully cased in its
boards. They tell me the coffin was carried to the churchyard,
but that it was too light to have contained the body,
and that it was followed by a black pig, which joined the
company forming the procession, nobody knew where, and
disappeared nobody knew when. When they reached the
church stile, a storm, similar in its character to that which
heralded the wrecker’s death, came on. The bearers of the
coffin were obliged to leave it without the churchyard stile
and rush into the church for safety. The storm lasted long
and raged with violence, and all was as dark as night. A
sudden blaze of light, more vivid than before, was seen, and
those who had the hardihood to look out saw that the lightning
had set fire to the coffin, and it was being borne away
through the air, blazing and whirling wildly in the grasp of
such a whirlwind as no man ever witnessed before or since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading86">THE SPECTRE SHIP OF PORTHCURNO.</h3>

<p>Porthcurno Cove is situated a little to the west of
the Logan Stone. There, as in nearly all the coves
around the coast, once existed a small chapel<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> or oratory,
which appears to have been dedicated to St Leven. There
exists now a little square enclosure about the size of a
(<i>bougie</i>) sheep’s house, which is all that remains of this little
holy place. Looking up the valley, (Bottom,) you may see a
few trees, with the chimney-tops and part of the roof of an
old-fashioned house. That place is Raftra, where they say
St Leven Church was to have been built; but as fast as the
stones were taken there by day, they were removed by night
to the place of the present church. (These performances
are usually the act of the devil, but I have no information
as to the saint or sinner who did this work.) Raftra House,
at the time it was built, was the largest mansion west of
Penzance. It is said to have been erected by the Tresillians,
and, ere it was finished, they appear to have been obliged to
sell house and lands for less than it had cost them to build
the house.</p>

<p>This valley is in every respect a melancholy spot, and
during a period of storms, or at night, it is exactly the place
which might well be haunted by demon revellers. In the
days of the saint from whom the parish has its name—St
Leven—he lived a long way up from the cove, at a place
called Bodelan, and his influence made that, which is now so
dreary, a garden. By his pure holiness he made the wilderness
a garden of flowers, and spread gladness where now is
desolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Few persons cared to cross that valley after nightfall; and
it is not more than thirty years since that I had a narrative
from an inhabitant of Penberth, that he himself had seen
the spectre ship sailing over the land.</p>

<p>This strange apparition is said to have been observed frequently,
coming in from sea about nightfall, when the mists
were rising from the marshy ground in the Bottoms.</p>

<p>Onward came the ill-omened craft. It passed steadily
through the breakers on the shore, glided up over the sands,
and steadily pursued its course over the dry land, as if it had
been water. She is described to have been a black, square-rigged,
single-masted affair, usually, but not always, followed
by a boat. No crew was ever seen. It is supposed they
were below, and that the hatches were battened down. On
it went to Bodelan, where St Leven formerly dwelt. It
would then steer its course to Chygwiden, and there vanish
like smoke.</p>

<p>Many of the old people have seen this ship, and no one
ever saw it, upon whom some bad luck was not sure to fall.</p>

<p>This ship is somehow connected with a strange man who
returned from sea, and went to live at Chygwiden. It
may be five hundred years since—it may be but fifty.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a servant of foreign and forbidding
aspect, who continued to be his only attendant; and
this servant was never known to speak to any one save his
master. It is said by some they were pirates; others make
them more familiar, by calling them privateers; while some
insist upon it they were American bucaneers. Whatever
they may have been, there was but little seen of them by
any of their neighbours. They kept a boat at Porthcurno
Cove, and at daylight they would start for sea, never returning
until night, and not unfrequently remaining out the
whole of the night, especially if the weather was tempestuous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
This kind of sea-life was varied by hunting. It mattered
not to them whether it was day or night; when the
storm was loudest, there was this strange man, accompanied
either by his servant or by the devil, and the midnight cry of
his dogs would disturb the country.</p>

<p>This mysterious being died, and then the servant sought
the aid of a few of the peasantry to bear his coffin to the
churchyard. The corpse was laid in the grave, around which
the dogs were gathered, with the foreigner in their midst.
As soon as the earth was thrown on the coffin, man and
dogs disappeared, and, strange to say, the boat disappeared
at the same moment from the cove. It has never since
been seen; and from that day to this no one has been able
to keep a boat in Porthcurno Cove.</p>

<h3 id="heading87">THE LADY WITH THE LANTERN.</h3>

<p>The night was dark and the wind high. The heavy
waves rolled round the point of “the Island” into St
Ives Bay, as Atlantic waves only can roll. Everything bespoke
a storm of no ordinary character. There were no
ships in the bay—not a fishing-boat was afloat. The few
small trading vessels had run into Hayle for shelter, or had
nestled themselves within that very unquiet resting-place, St
Ives pier. The fishing-boats were all high and dry on the
sands.</p>

<p>Moving over the rocks which run out into the sea from
the eastern side of “the Island,” was seen a light. It passed
over the most rugged ridges, formed by the intrusive Greenstone
masses, and over the sharp edges of the upturned slate-rocks,
with apparent ease. Forth and back—to and from—wandered
the light.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said an old sailor with a sigh, as he looked out over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the sea; “a sad night! a sad night! The Lady and the
Lantern is out.”</p>

<p>“The Lady and the Lantern,” repeated I; “what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“The light out yonder”——</p>

<p>“Is from the lantern of some fisherman looking for something
he has lost,” interrupted I.</p>

<p>“Never a fisherman nor a ‘salt’ either would venture
there to-night,” said the sailor.</p>

<p>“What is it, then?” I curiously inquired.</p>

<p>“Ha’ast never heard of the Lady and the Lantern?” asked
a woman who was standing by.</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>Without any preface, she began at once to enlighten me.
I am compelled, however, to reduce her rambling story to
something like order, and to make her long-drawn tale as
concise as possible.</p>

<p>In the year —— there were many wrecks around the
coast. It was a melancholy time. For more than a month
there had been a succession of storms, each one more severe
than the preceding one. At length, one evening, just about
dusk, a large ship came suddenly out of the mist. Her position,
it was at once discovered, equally by those on board and
by the people on the shore, was perilous beyond hope. The
sailors, as soon as they saw how near they were to the shore,
made every effort to save the ship, and then to prepare for
saving themselves. The tempest raged with such fury from
the west, that the ship parted her anchors at the moment her
strain came upon them, and she swang round,—her only sail
flying into ribbons in the gale—rushing, as it were, eagerly
upon her fate. Presently she struck violently upon a sunken
rock, and her masts went by the board, the waves sweeping
over her, and clearing her decks. Many perished at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and, as each successive wave urged her onward, others of
the hardy and daring seamen were swept into the angry
sea.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the severity of the storm, a boat was
manned by the St Ives fishermen, and launched from within
the pier. Their perfect knowledge of their work enabled
them, by the efforts of willing hearts, anxiously desiring to
succour the distressed, to round the pier-head, and to row
towards the ship.</p>

<p>These fishermen brought their boat near to the ship. It
was impossible to get close to her, and they called to the
sailors on board to throw them ropes. This they were enabled
to do, and some two or three of the sailors lowered
themselves by their aid, and were hauled into the boat.</p>

<p>Then a group appeared on the deck, surrounding and supporting
a lady, who held a child in her arms. They were
imploring her to give her charge into the strong arms of a
man ere they endeavoured to pass her from the ship to the
boat.</p>

<p>The lady could not be prevailed on to part with the infant.
The ship was fast breaking up, not a moment could be lost.
So the lady, holding her child, was lowered into the sea, and
eagerly the fishermen drew her through the waves towards
the boat.</p>

<p>In her passage the lady had fainted, and she was taken
into the boat without the infant. The child had fallen from
her arms, and was lost in the boiling waters.</p>

<p>Many of the crew were saved by these adventurous men,
and taken safely into St Ives. Before morning the shore
was strewed with fragments of wreck, and the mighty ship
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Life returned to the lady; but, finding that her child was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
gone, it returned without hope, and she speedily closed her
eyes in death. In the churchyard they buried her; but,
shortly after her burial, a lady was seen to pass over the wall
of the churchyard, on to the beach, and walk towards the
Island. There she spent hours amidst the rocks, looking for
her child, and not finding it, she would sigh deeply and
return to her grave. When the nights were tempestuous or
very dark, she carried a lantern; but on fine nights she
made her search without a light. The Lady and the Lantern
have ever been regarded as predictors of disaster on this
shore.</p>

<p>May not the Lady Sibella, or Sibbets, mentioned by Mr
Blight as passing from the shore to a rock off Morva, be but
another version of this story?</p>

<h3 id="heading88">THE DROWNED “HAILING THEIR NAMES.”</h3>

<p>The fishermen dread to walk at night near those parts of
the shore where there may have been wrecks. The
souls of the drowned sailors appear to haunt those spots, and
the “calling of the dead” has frequently been heard. I
have been told that, under certain circumstances, especially
before the coming of storms, or at certain seasons, but
always at night, these callings are common. Many a fisherman
has declared he has heard the voices of dead sailors
“hailing their own names.”</p>

<h3 id="heading89">THE VOICE FROM THE SEA.</h3>

<p>A fisherman or a pilot was walking one night on the
sands at Porth-Towan, when all was still save the
monotonous fall of the light waves upon the sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>He distinctly heard a voice from the sea exclaiming,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The hour is come, but not the man.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was repeated three times when a black figure, like that
of a man, appeared on the top of the hill. It paused for a
moment, then rushed impetuously down the steep incline,
over the sands, and was lost in the sea.</p>

<p>In different forms this story is told all around the Cornish
coast.</p>

<h3 id="heading90">THE SMUGGLER’S TOKEN.</h3>

<p>Until about the time of the close of the last French war,
a large portion of the inhabitants of the south-west
coast of Cornwall were in some way or other connected with
the practice of smuggling. The traffic with the opposite
coast was carried on principally in boats or undecked vessels.
The risks encountered by their crews produced a race of
hardy, fearless men, a few of whom are still living, and it
has been said that the Government of those days winked at
the infraction of the law, from an unwillingness to destroy
so excellent a school for seamen. Recently the demand for
ardent spirits has so fallen off that there is no longer an
inducement to smuggle; still it is sometimes exultingly
rumoured that, the “Coast Guard having been cleverly put
off the scent, a cargo has been successfully run.” The little
coves in the Lizard promontory formed the principal trading
places, the goods being taken as soon as landed to various
places of concealment, whence they were withdrawn as required
for disposal. About eighty years since, a boat, laden
with “ankers” of spirits, was about, with its crew, to leave
Mullion Cove for Newlyn. One of the farmers concerned
in the venture, members of whose family are still living, was
persuaded to accompany them, and entered the boat for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
purpose, but, recollecting he had business at Helston, got out
again, and the boat left without him. On his return from
Helston, late in the evening, he sat down, exclaiming, “The
boat and all on board are lost! I met the men as I passed
the top of Halzaphron, (a very high cliff on the road,) with
their hair and clothes dripping wet!” In spite of the arguments
of his friends, he persisted in his statement. The
boat and crew were never more heard of, and the farmer was
so affected by the circumstance, that he pined and died
shortly after.</p>

<h3 id="heading91">THE HOOPER, OR THE HOOTER, OF SENNEN COVE.</h3>

<p>This was supposed to be a spirit which took the form of
a band of misty vapour, stretching across the bay, so
opaque that nothing could be seen through it. It was regarded
as a kindly interposition of some ministering spirit, to warn
the fishermen against venturing to sea. This appearance
was always followed, and often suddenly, by a severe storm.
It is seldom or ever seen now. One profane old fisherman
would not be warned by the bank of fog. The weather was
fine on the shore, and the waves fell tranquilly on the sands;
and this aged sinner, declaring he would not be made a fool
of, persuaded some young men to join him. They manned
a boat, and the aged leader, having with him a threshing-flail,
blasphemously declared that he would drive the spirit
away; and he vigorously beat the fog with the “threshel”—so
the flail is called.</p>

<p>The boat passed through the fog, and went to sea. A
severe storm came on. No one ever saw the boat or the men
again; and since that time the Hooper has been rarely
seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading92">HOW TO EAT PILCHARDS.</h3>

<p>It is unlucky to commence eating pilchards, or, indeed, any
kind of fish, from the head downwards. I have often heard
persons rebuked for committing such a grievous sin, which is
“sure to turn the heads of the fish away from the coasts.”</p>

<p>The legitimate process—mark this, all fish-eaters—<i>is to
eat the fish from the tail towards the head</i>. This brings
the fish to our shores, and secures good luck to the fishermen.</p>

<h3 id="heading93">PILCHARDS CRYING FOR MORE.</h3>

<p>When there is a large catch of fish, (pilchards,) they are
preserved,—put in bulk, as the phrase is,—by being
rubbed with salt, and placed in regular order, one on the
other, head and tails alternately, forming regular walls of
fish.</p>

<p>The fish often, when so placed, make a squeaking noise;
this is called “crying for more,” and is regarded as a most
favourable sign. More fish may soon be expected to be
brought to the same cellar.</p>

<p>The noise which is heard is really produced by the bursting
of the air-bladders; and when many break together,
which, when hundreds of thousands are piled in a mass, is
not unusual, the sound is a loud one.</p>

<h3 id="heading94">THE PRESSING-STONES.</h3>

<p>Those who are not familiar with the process of “curing,”
(salting) pilchards for the Italian markets, will require
a little explanation to understand the accompanying
story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The pilchards being caught in vast quantities, often,
amounting to many thousand hogsheads at a time, in an
enclosing net called a “seine,” are taken out of it—the larger
net—in a smaller net, called the “tuck net,” and from it
loaded into boats and taken to the shore. They are quickly
transferred to the fish-sellers, and “put in bulk”—that is,
they are well rubbed with salt, and carefully packed up—all
interstitial spaces being filled with salt—in a pile several feet
in height and depth. They remain in this condition for about
six weeks, when they are removed from “the bulk,” washed,
and put into barrels in very regular order. The barrels being
filled with pilchards, pressing-stones,—round masses of granite,
weighing about a hundredweight,—with an iron hook fixed
into them for the convenience of moving, are placed on
the fish. By this they are much compressed, and a considerable
quantity of oil is squeezed out of them. This process
being completed, the cask is “headed,” marked, and is ready
for exportation.</p>

<p>Jem Tregose and his old woman, with two sons and a
daughter, lived over one of the fish-cellars in St Ives. For
many years there had been a great scarcity of fish;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> their
cellar had been empty; Jem and his boys were fishermen,
and it had long been hard times with them. It is true they
went out “hook-and-line” fishing now and then, and got a
little money. They had gone over to Ireland on the herring-fishing,
but very little luck attended them.</p>

<p>Summer had passed away, and the early autumn was upon
them. The seine-boats were out day after day, but no “signs
of fish.” One evening, when the boys came home, Ann
Jenny Tregose had an unusual smile upon her face, and
her daughter Janniper, who had long suffered from the
“megrims,” was in capital spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, mother,” says one of the sons, “and what ails
thee a’?”</p>

<p>“The press-stones a bin rolling.”</p>

<p>“Haas they, sure enuff,” says the old man.</p>

<p>“Ees! ees!” exclaims Janniper; “they has been making
a skimmage!”</p>

<p>“Hark ye,” cries the old woman, “there they go
again.”</p>

<p>And sure enough there was a heavy rolling of the stones
in the cellar below them. It did not require much imagination
to image these round granite pebbles sliding themselves
down on the “couse,” or stone flooring, and dividing themselves
up into sets, as if for a dance,—a regular “cows’
courant,” or game of romps.</p>

<p>“Fish to-morrow!” exclaimed the old woman. The ejaculations
of each one of the party shewed their perfect faith in
the belief, that the stones rolling down from the heap, in
which they had been useless for some time, was a certain
indication that pilchards were approaching the coast.</p>

<p>Early on the morrow the old man and his sons were on
their “stem;” and shortly after daylight the cry of “Heva!
heva!”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> was heard from the hills; the seine was shot, and ere
night a large quantity of fish might be seen in the cellar, and
every one joyous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading95">WHIPPING THE HAKE.</h3>

<p>It is not improbable that the saying applied to the
people of one of the Cornish fishing-towns, of “Who
whipped the hake?” may be explained by the following:—</p>

<p>“Lastly, they are persecuted by the hakes, who (not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
sithence) haunted the coast in great abundance; but now
being deprived of their wonted bait, are much diminished,
verifying the proverb, ‘<i>What we lose in hake we shall have
in herring</i>.’”—<i>Carew, Survey</i>, p. 34.</p>

<p>Annoyed with the hakes, the seiners may, in their ignorance,
have actually served one of those fish as indicated.</p>

<p class="dropcap">When you cross the brook which divides St Leven
from Sennen, you are on the estate of Treville.</p>

<p>Tradition tells us that this estate was given to
an old family who came with the Conqueror to
this country. This ancestor is said to have been the Duke of
Normandy’s wine-taster, and that he belonged to the ancient
counts of Treville, hence the name of the estate. Certain it
is the property has ever been held without poll deeds. For
many generations the family has been declining, and the race
is now nearly, if not quite, extinct.</p>

<p>Through all time a peculiar token has marked the coming
death of a Vingoe. Above the deep caverns in the Treville
cliff rises a carn. On this, chains of fire were seen ascending
and descending, and often accompanied by loud and
frightful noises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that these tokens have not been seen since the
last male of the family came to a violent end.</p>

<h3 id="heading97">THE DEATH FETCH OF WILLIAM RUFUS.</h3>

<p>Robert, Earl of Moreton, in Normandy,—who always
carried the standard of St Michael before him in
battle,—was made Earl of Cornwall by William the Conqueror.
He was remarkable for his valour and for his virtue,
for the exercise of his power, and his benevolence to the
priests. This was the Earl of Cornwall who gave the Mount
in Cornwall to the monks of Mont St Michel in Normandy.
He seized upon the priory of St Petroc at Bodmin, and converted
all the lands to his own use.</p>

<p>This Earl of Cornwall was an especial friend of William
Rufus. It happened that Robert, the earl, was hunting in
the extensive woods around Bodmin—of which some remains
are still to be found in the Glyn Valley. The chase had
been a severe one; a fine old red deer had baffled the huntsmen,
and they were dispersed through the intricacies of the
forest, the Earl of Cornwall being left alone. He advanced
beyond the shades of the woods on to the moors above them,
and he was surprised to see a very large black goat advancing
over the plain. As it approached him, which it did
rapidly, he saw that it bore on its back “King Rufus,” all
black and naked, and wounded through in the midst of his
breast. Robert adjured the goat, in the name of the Holy
Trinity, to tell what it was he carried so strangely. He
answered, “I am carrying your king to judgment; yea,
that tyrant William Rufus, for I am an evil spirit, and the
revenger of his malice which he bore to the Church of God.
It was I that did cause this slaughter; the protomartyr of
England, St Albyn, commanding me so to do, who complained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to God of him, for his grievous oppression in this
Isle of Britain, which he first hallowed.” Having so spoken,
the spectre vanished. Robert, the earl, related the circumstance
to his followers, and they shortly after learned that at
that very hour William Rufus had been slain in the New
Forest by the arrow of Walter Tirell.</p>

<h3 id="heading98">SIR JOHN ARUNDELL.</h3>

<p>In the first year of the reign of Edward IV., the brave Sir
John Arundell dwelt on the north coast of Cornwall, at
a place called Efford, on the coast near Stratton. He was a
magistrate, and greatly esteemed amongst men for his honourable
conduct. He had, however, in his official capacity,
given offence to a wild shepherd, who had by some means
acquired considerable influence over the minds of the people,
under the impression of his possessing some supernatural
powers. This man had been imprisoned by Arundell, and
on his return home he constantly waylaid the knight, and,
always looking threateningly at him, slowly muttered,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When upon the yellow sand,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shalt die by human hand.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the bravery of Sir John Arundell, he was
not free from the superstitions of the period. He might, indeed,
have been impressed with the idea that this man intended
to murder him. It is, however, certain that he
removed from Efford on the sands, to the wood-clad hills of
Trerice, and here he lived for some years without the annoyance
of meeting his old enemy. In the tenth year of Edward
IV., Richard de Vere, earl of Oxford, seized St Michael’s
Mount. Sir John Arundell, then sheriff of Cornwall, gathered
together his own retainers and a large host of volunteers,
and led them to the attack on St Michael’s Mount. The retainers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the Earl of Oxford, on one occasion, left the castle,
and made a sudden rush upon Arundell’s followers, who were
encamped on the sands near Marazion. Arundell then received
his death-wound. Although he left Efford “to counteract
the will of fate,” the prophecy was fulfilled; and in
his dying moments, it is said his old enemy appeared, singing
joyously,—</p>

<h3 id="heading99">PHANTOMS OF THE DYING.</h3>

<p>A gay party were assembled one afternoon, in the latter
days of January, in the best parlour of a farmhouse
near the Land’s-End. The inhabitants of this district were,
in many respects, peculiar. Nearly all the land was divided
up between, comparatively, a few owners, and every owner
lived on and farmed his own land.</p>

<p>This circumstance, amongst others, led to a certain amount
of style in many of the old farmhouses of the Land’s-End
district; and even now, in some of them, from which, alas!
the glory has departed, may be seen the evidences of taste
beyond that which might have been expected in so remote
a district.</p>

<p>The “best parlour” was frequently panelled with carved
oak, and the ceiling, often highly, though it must be admitted,
heavily decorated. In such a room, in the declining
light of a January afternoon, were some ten or a dozen farmers’
daughters, all of them unmarried, and many of them
having an eye on the farmer’s eldest son, a fine young man
about twenty years of age, called Joseph.</p>

<p>This farmer and his wife, at the time of which we speak,
had three sons and two daughters. The eldest son was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
excellent and amiable young man, possessed of many personal
attractions, and especially fond of the society of his sisters
and their friends. The next son was of a very different
stamp, and was more frequently found in the inn at Church-town
than in his father’s house; the younger son was an
apprentice at Penzance. The two daughters, Mary and
Honour, had coaxed their mother into “a tea and heavy
cake” party, and Joseph was especially retained, to be, as
every one said he was, “the life of the company.”</p>

<p>In those days, when, especially in those parts, every one
took dinner at noon, and tea not much after four o’clock, the
party had assembled early.</p>

<p>There had been the usual preliminary gossip amongst the
young people, when they began to talk about the wreck of a
fruit-ship which had occurred but a few days before, off the
Land’s-End, and it was said that considerable quantities of
oranges were washing into Nangissell Cove. Upon this,
Joseph said he would take one of the men from the farm,
and go down to the cove—which was not far off—and see
if they could not find some oranges for the ladies.</p>

<p>The day had faded into twilight, the western sky was still
bright with the light of the setting sun, and the illuminated
clouds shed a certain portion of their splendour into the room
in which the party were assembled. The girls were divided
up into groups, having their own pretty little bits of gossip,
often truly delightful from its entire freedom and its innocence;
and the mother of Joseph was seated near the fireplace,
looking with some anxiety through the windows, from
which you commanded a view of the Atlantic Ocean. The
old lady was restless; sometimes she had to whisper something
to Mary, and then some other thing to Honour. Her
anxiety, at length, was expressed in her wondering where
Joseph could be tarrying so long. All the young ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
sought to ease her mind by saying that there were no doubt
so many orange-gatherers in the Cove, that Joseph and the
man could not get so much fruit as he desired.</p>

<p>Joseph was the favourite son of his mother, and her
anxiety evidently increased. Eventually, starting from her
chair, the old lady exclaimed, “Oh, here he is; now I’ll see
about the tea.”</p>

<p>With a pleased smile on her face, she left the room, to
return, however, to it in deeper sorrow.</p>

<p>The mother expected to meet her son at the door—he
came not. Thinking that he might possibly have been
wetted by the sea, and that he had gone round the house to
another door leading directly into the kitchen, for the purpose
of drying himself, or of changing his boots, she went
into the dairy to fetch the basin of clotted cream,—which
had been “taken up” with unusual care,—to see if the junket
was properly set, and to spread the flaky cream thickly upon
its surface.</p>

<p>Strange,—as the old lady subsequently related,—all the
pans of milk were agitated—“the milk rising up and down
like the waves of the sea.”</p>

<p>The anxious mother returned to the parlour with her basin
of cream, but with an indescribable feeling of an unknown
terror. She commanded herself, and, in her usual quiet way,
asked if Joseph had been in. When they answered her
“No,” she sighed heavily, and sank senseless into a chair.</p>

<p>Neither Joseph nor the servant ever returned alive. They
were seen standing together upon a rock, stooping to gather
oranges as they came with each wave up to their feet, when
one of the heavy swells—the lingering undulations of a
tempest, so well known on this coast—came sweeping onward,
and carried them both away in its cave of waters, as
the wave curved to ingulf them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The undertow of the tidal current was so strong that,
though powerful men and good swimmers, they were carried
at once beyond all human aid, and speedily perished.</p>

<p>The house of joy became a house of mourning, and sadness
rested on it for years. Day after day passed by, and,
although a constant watch was kept along the coast, it was
not until the fated ninth day that the bodies were discovered,
and they were then found in a sadly mutilated state.</p>

<p>Often after long years, and when the consolations derivable
from pure religious feeling had brought that tranquillity
upon the mind of this loving mother,—which so much resembles
the poetical repose of an autumnal evening,—has she
repeated to me the sad tale.</p>

<p>Again and again have I heard her declare that she saw
Joseph, her son, as distinctly as ever she saw him in her life,
and that, as he passed the parlour windows, he looked in
upon her and smiled.</p>

<p>This is not given as a superstition belonging in any peculiar
way to Cornwall. In every part of the British Isles it
exists; but I have never met with any people who so firmly
believed in the appearance of the phantoms of the dying to
those upon whom the last thoughts are centred, as the
Cornish did.</p>

<p>Another case is within my knowledge.</p>

<p>A lady, the wife of an officer in the navy, had been with
her husband’s sister, on a summer evening, to church. The
husband was in the Mediterranean, and there was no reason
to expect his return for many months.</p>

<p>These two ladies returned home, and the wife, ascending
the stairs before her sister-in-law, went into the drawing-room—her
intention being to close the windows, which, as
the weather had been warm and fine, had been thrown open.</p>

<p>She had proceeded about half way across the room, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
she shrieked, ran back, and fell into her sister-in-law’s arms.
Upon recovery, she stated that a figure, like that of her
husband, enveloped in a mist, appeared to her to fill one
of the windows.</p>

<p>By her friends, the wife’s fancies were laughed at; and, if
not forgotten, the circumstance was no longer spoken of.</p>

<p>Month after month glided by, without intelligence of the
ship to which that officer belonged. At length the Government
became anxious, and searching inquiries were made.
Some time still elapsed, but eventually it was ascertained
that this sloop of war had perished in a white squall, in which
she became involved, near the Island of Mitylene, in the
Grecian Archipelago, on the Sunday evening when the widow
fancied she saw her husband.</p>

<h3 id="heading100">THE WHITE HARE.</h3>

<p>It is a very popular fancy that when a maiden, who has
loved not wisely but too well, dies forsaken and broken-hearted,
that she comes back to haunt her deceiver in the
shape of a white hare.</p>

<p>This phantom follows the false one everywhere, mostly invisible
to all but him. It sometimes saves him from danger,
but invariably the white hare causes the death of the betrayer
in the end.</p>

<p>The following story of the white hare is a modification of
several tales of the same kind which have been told me.
Many, many years have passed away, and all who were in any
way connected with my story have slept for generations in
the quiet churchyard of ——.</p>

<p>A large landed proprietor engaged a fine, handsome young
fellow to manage his farm, which was a very extensive as well
as a high-class one. When the young farmer was duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
settled in his new farmhouse, there came to live with him,
to take the management of the dairy, a peasant’s daughter.
She was very handsome, and of a singularly fine figure, but
entirely without education.</p>

<p>The farmer became desperately in love with this young
creature, and eventually their love passed all the bounds of
discretion. It became the policy of the young farmer’s
family to put down this unfortunate passion, by substituting
a more legitimate and endearing object.</p>

<p>After a long trial, they thought they were successful, and
the young farmer was married.</p>

<p>Many months had not passed away when the discharged
dairy-maid was observed to suffer from illness, which, however,
she constantly spoke of as nothing; but knowing dames
saw too clearly the truth. One morning there was found in
a field a newly-born babe strangled. The unfortunate girl
was at once suspected as being the parent, and the evidence
was soon sufficient to charge her with the murder. She was
tried, and, chiefly by the evidence of the young farmer and
his family, convicted of, and executed for, the murder.</p>

<p>Everything now went wrong in the farm, and the young
man suddenly left it and went into another part of the
country.</p>

<p>Still nothing prospered, and gradually he took to drink to
drown some secret sorrow. He was more frequently on the
road by night than by day; and, go where he would, a white
hare was constantly crossing his path. The white hare was
often seen by others, almost always under the feet of his
horse; and the poor terrified animal would go like the wind
to avoid the strange apparition.</p>

<p>One morning the young farmer was found drowned in a
forsaken mine; and the horse, which had evidently suffered
extreme terror, was grazing near the corpse. Beyond all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
doubt the white hare, which is known to hunt the perjured
and the false-hearted to death, had terrified the horse to such
a degree, that eventually the rider was thrown into the mine-waste
in which the body was found.</p>

<h3 id="heading101">THE HAND OF A SUICIDE.</h3>

<p>Placing the hand of a man who has died by his own
act is a cure for many diseases.</p>

<p>The following is given me by a thinking man, living in one
of the towns in the west of Cornwall:—</p>

<p>“There is a young man in this town who had been afflicted
with running tumours from his birth. When about seventeen
years of age he had the hand of a man who had hanged
himself passed over the wounds on his back, and, strange to
say, he recovered from that time, and is now comparatively
robust and hearty. This incident is true; I was present
when the charm was performed. It should be observed that
the notion appears to be that the ‘touch’ is only effectual
on the opposite sex; but in this case they were both, the
suicide and the afflicted one, of the same sex.”</p>

<p>This is only a modified form of the superstition that a wen,
or any strumous swelling, can be cured by touching it with
the dead hand of a man who has just been publicly hanged.</p>

<p>I once saw a young woman led on to the scaffold, in the
Old Bailey, for the purpose of having a wen touched with the
hand of a man who had just been executed.</p>

<h3 id="heading102">THE NORTH SIDE OF A CHURCH.</h3>

<p>A strong prejudice has long existed against burying on
the northern side of the church. In many churchyards
the southern side will be found full of graves, with
scarcely any on the northern side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>I have sought to discover, if possible, the origin of this
prejudice, but I have not been able to trace it to any well-defined
feeling. I have been answered, “Oh, we like to bury
a corpse where the sun will shine on the grave;” and, “The
northern graveyard is in the shadow, and cold;” but beyond
this I have not advanced.</p>

<p>We may infer that this desire to place the remains of our
friends in earth on which the sun shines, is born of that love
which, forgetting mortality, lives on the pleasant memories
of the past, hoping for that meeting beyond the grave which
shall know no shadow. The act of planting flowers, of nurturing
an evergreen tree, of hanging “eternals” on the
tomb, is only another form of the same sacred feeling.</p>

<h3 id="heading103">POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>

<p>It is, or rather was, believed, in nearly every part of the
West of England, that death is retarded, and the dying
kept in a state of suffering, by having any lock closed, or any
bolt shot, in the dwelling of the dying person.</p>

<p>A man cannot die easy on a bed made of fowls’ feathers,
or the feathers of wild birds.</p>

<p>Never carry a corpse to church by a new road.</p>

<p>Whenever a guttering candle folds over its cooling grease,
it is watched with much anxiety. If it curls upon itself it
is said to form the “handle of a coffin,” and the person
towards whom it is directed will be in danger of death.</p>

<p>Bituminous coal not unfrequently swells into bubbles,
these bubbles of coal containing carburetted hydrogen gas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
When the pressure becomes great they burst, and often
throw off the upper section with some explosive force.
According to the shape of the piece thrown off, so is it
named. If it proves round it is a purse of money; if oblong,
it is a coffin, and the group towards which it flew will be in
danger.</p>

<p>If a cock crows at midnight, the angel of death is passing
over the house; and if he delays to strike, the delay is only
for a short season.</p>

<p>The howling of a dog is a sad sign. If repeated for three
nights, the house against which it howled will soon be in
mourning.</p>

<p>A raven croaking over a cottage fills its inmates with
gloom.</p>

<p>There are many other superstitions and tokens connected
with life and death, but those given shew the general character
of those feelings which I may, I think, venture to call
the “inner life” of the Cornish people. It will be understood
by all who have studied the peculiarities of any Celtic
race, that they have ever been a peculiarly impressible people.
They have ever observed the phenomena of nature; and they
have interpreted them with hopeful feelings, or despondent
anxiety, according as they have been surrounded by cheerful
or by sorrow-inducing circumstances. That melancholy state
of mind, which is so well expressed by the word “whisht,”
leads the sufferer to find a “sign” or a “token” in the
trembling of a leaf, or in the lowering of the tempest-clouds.
A collection of the almost infinite variety of these “signs
and tokens” which still exist, would form a curious subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
for an essay. Yet this could only now be done by a person
who would skilfully win the confidence of the miner or the
peasant. They feel that they might subject themselves to
ridicule by an indiscreet disclosure of the religion of their
souls. When, if ever, such a collection is made, it will be
found that these superstitions have their origin in the purest
feelings of the heart—that they are the shadowings forth of
love, tinctured with the melancholy dyes of that fear which is
born of mystery.</p>

<p>One would desire that even those old superstitions should
be preserved. They illustrate a state of society, in the past,
which will never again return. There are but few reflecting
minds which do not occasionally feel a lingering regret that
times should pass away during which life was not a reflection
of cold reason.</p>

<p>But these things must fade as a knowledge of nature’s
laws is disseminated amongst the people. Yet there is—</p>

<h2>CUSTOMS OF ANCIENT DAYS.</h2>

<h3 id="heading104">SANDING THE STEP ON NEW YEAR’S-DAY.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They say, miracles are past, and we have our philosophical persons, to
make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it
that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge.”—<i>All’s
Well that Ends Well</i>—<span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>.</p>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In the rural districts of Cornwall, it is thought to
be unlucky if a female is the first to enter the
house on new-year’s morning. To insure the
contrary, it was customary to give boys some
small reward for placing sand on the door-steps and in the
passage.</p>

<p>In many places, not many years since, droves of boys
would march through the towns and villages, collecting their
fees for “sanding your step for good luck.”</p>

<p>This custom prevails over most parts of England. I know
a lady who, at the commencement of the present year, sent
a cabman into her house before her, upon promise of giving
him a glass of spirits, so that she might insure the good
luck which depends upon “a man’s taking the new year
in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading105">MAY-DAY.</h3>

<p>The first of May is inaugurated with much uproar. As
soon as the clock has told of midnight, a loud blast on
tin trumpets proclaims the advent of May. This is long
continued. At daybreak, with their “tintarrems,” they proceed
to the country, and strip the sycamore-trees (called May-trees)
of all their young branches, to make whistles. With
these shrill musical instruments they return home. Young
men and women devote May-day to junketing and pic-nics.</p>

<p>It was a custom at Penzance, and probably at many other
Cornish towns, when the author was a boy, for a number of
young people to sit up until twelve o’clock, and then to
march round the town with violins and fifes, and summon
their friends to the Maying.</p>

<p>When all were gathered, they went into the country, and
were welcomed at the farmhouses at which they called, with
some refreshment in the shape of rum and milk, junket, or
something of that sort.</p>

<p>They then gathered the “May,” which included the young
branches of any tree in blossom or fresh leaf. The branches
of the sycamore were especially cut for the purpose of
making the “May music.” This was done by cutting a
circle through the bark to the wood a few inches from the
end of the branch. The bark was wetted and carefully
beaten until it was loosened and could be slid off from the
wood. The wood was cut angularly at the end, so as to
form a mouth-piece, and a slit was made in both the bark and
the wood, so that when the bark was replaced a whistle was
formed. Prepared with a sufficient number of May whistles,
all the party returned to the town, the band playing, whistles
blowing, and the young people singing some appropriate
song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading106">SHROVE TUESDAY AT ST IVES.</h3>

<p>Formerly it was customary for the boys to tie stones
to cords, and with these parade the town, slinging
these stones against the doors, shouting aloud,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Give me a pancake, now—now—now,</div>
<div class="verse">Or I’ll souse in your door with a row—tow—tow.”</div>

</div>

<p>A genteel correspondent assures me “this is observed
now in the lower parts of the town only.”</p>

<h3 id="heading107">“THE FURRY”—HELSTONE.</h3>

<p>This ancient custom, which consists in dancing through
the streets of the town, and entering the houses of
rich and poor alike, is thus well described:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the 8th of May, at Helstone, in Cornwall, is held what is called
‘the Furry.’ The word is supposed by Mr Polwhele to have been derived
from the old Cornish word <i>fer</i>, a fair or jubilee. The morning is ushered
in by the music of drums and kettles, and other accompaniments of a song,
a great part of which is inserted in Mr Polwhele’s history, where this circumstance
is noticed. So strict is the observance of this day as a general
holiday, that should any person be found at work, he is instantly seized,
set astride on a pole, and hurried on men’s shoulders to the river, where
he is sentenced to leap over a wide place, which he, of course, fails in attempting,
and leaps into the water. A small contribution towards the good
cheer of the day easily compounds for the leap. About nine o’clock the
revellers appear before the grammar-school, and demand a holiday for the
schoolboys, after which they collect contributions from houses. They
then <i>fade</i> into the country, (fade being an old English word for <i>go</i>,) and,
about the middle of the day, return with flowers and oak-branches in their
hats and caps. From this time they dance hand in hand through the
streets, to the sound of the fiddle, playing a particular tune, running into
every house they pass without opposition. In the afternoon a select party
of the ladies and gentlemen make a progress through the street, and very
late in the evening repair to the ball-room. A stranger visiting the town
on the eighth of May would really think the people mad, so apparently
wild and thoughtless is the merriment of the day. There is no doubt of
‘the Furry’ originating from the ‘Floralia,’ anciently observed by the
Romans on the fourth of the calends of May.”—<i>Every-Day Book.</i></p>

<h3 id="heading108">MIDSUMMER SUPERSTITIOUS CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p>If on midsummer-eve a young woman takes off the shift
which she has been wearing, and, having washed
it, turns it wrong side out, and hangs it in silence over
the back of a chair, near the fire, she will see, about midnight,
her future husband, who deliberately turns the garment.</p>

<p>If a young lady will, on midsummer-eve, walk backwards
into the garden and gather a rose, she has the means of
knowing who is to be her husband. The rose must be cautiously
sewn up in a paper bag, and put aside in a dark
drawer, there to remain until Christmas-day.</p>

<p>On the morning of the Nativity the bag must be carefully
opened in silence, and the rose placed by the lady in
her bosom. Thus she must wear it to church. Some young
man will either ask for the rose, or take it from her without
asking. That young man is destined to become eventually
the lady’s husband.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“At eve last midsummer no sleep I sought,</div>
<div class="verse">But to the field a bag of hemp-seed brought;</div>
<div class="verse">I scatter’d round the seed on every side,</div>

</div>

<p>The practice of sowing hemp-seed on midsummer-eve is
not especially a Cornish superstition, yet it was at one time a
favourite practice with young women to try the experiment.
Many a strange story have I been told as to the result of
the sowing, and many a trick could I tell of, which has been
played off by young men who had become acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the secret intention of some maidens. I believe there is but
little difference in the rude rhyme used on the occasion,—</p>

<div class="verse">“Hemp-seed I sow,</div>
<div class="verse">Hemp-seed I hoe,”</div>

deliberately gone through;)—</p>

<p class="noindent">A phantom of the true lover will now appear, and of course
the maid or maidens retire in wild affright.</p>

<p>If a young unmarried woman stands at midnight on midsummer-eve
in the porch of the parish church, she will see,
passing by in procession, every one who will die in the
parish during the year. This is so serious an affair that it is
not, I believe, often tried. I have, however, heard of young
women who have made the experiment. But every one of
the stories relate that, coming last in the procession, they
have seen shadows of themselves; that from that day forward
they have pined, and ere midsummer has again come
round, that they have been laid to rest in the village graveyard.</p>

<h3 id="heading109">CRYING THE NECK.</h3>

<p>Owing to the uncertain character of the climate of Cornwall,
the farmers have adopted the plan of gathering
the sheaves of wheat, as speedily as possible, into “arish-mows.”
These are solid cones from ten to twelve feet high,
the heads of the stalks turned inwards, and the whole capped
with a sheaf of corn inverted. Whence the term, I know not;
but “arish” is commonly applied to a field of corn recently
cut, as, “Turn the geese in upon the ‘arish’”—that is, the
short stubble left in the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>After the wheat is all cut, on most farms in Cornwall and
Devon, the harvest people have a custom of “crying the
neck.” I believe that this practice is seldom omitted on any
large farm in these counties. It is done in this way. An old
man, or some one else well acquainted with the ceremonies
used on the occasion, (when the labourers are reaping the last
field of wheat,) goes round to the shocks and sheaves, and
picks out a little bundle of all the best ears he can find; this
bundle he ties up very neat and trim, and plats and arranges
the straws very tastefully. This is called “the neck”
of wheat, or wheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and
the pitcher once more circulated, the reapers, binders, and
the women stand round in a circle. The person with “the
neck” stands in the centre, grasping it with both his hands.
He first stoops and holds it near the ground, and all the
men forming the ring take off their hats, stooping and
holding them with both hands towards the ground. They
then all begin at once, in a very prolonged and harmonious
tone, to cry, “The neck!” at the same time slowly raising themselves
upright, and elevating their arms and hats above their
heads; the person with the neck also raising it on high. This
is done three times. They then change their cry to “We
yen! we yen!” which they sound in the same prolonged and
slow manner as before, with singular harmony and effect,
three times. This last cry is accompanied by the same
movements of the body and arms as in crying “the neck.”
I know nothing of vocal music, but I think I may convey
some idea of the sound by giving you the following notes in
gamut:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/music.jpg" width="500" height="100"
alt="Music: Treble clef, two bars of two F half-notes each. Words, one per note: We yen! We yen! Tempo: Very slow." />
</div>

<p>Let these notes be played on a flute with perfect <i>crescendoes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and <i>diminuendoes</i>, and perhaps some notion of this wild-sounding
cry may be formed. Well, after this they all burst
out into a kind of loud joyous laugh, flinging up their hats and
caps into the air, capering about, and perhaps kissing the girls.
One of them then gets “the neck,” and runs as hard as he
can down to the farmhouse, where the dairy-maid, or one
of the young female domestics, stands at the door prepared
with a pail of water. If he who holds “the neck” can
manage to get into the house in any way unseen, or openly
by any other way than the door at which the girl stands
with the pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her; but,
if otherwise, he is regularly soused with the contents of the
bucket. I think this practice is beginning to decline of
late, and many farmers and their men do not care about
keeping up this old custom. The object of crying “the
neck” is to give notice to the surrounding country of the
<i>end</i> of the harvest, and the meaning of “we yen” is “<i>we
have ended</i>.” It may probably mean “we end,” which the
uncouth and provincial pronunciation has corrupted into
“we yen.” The “neck” is generally hung up in the farmhouse,
where it often remains for three or four years.</p>

<h3 id="heading110">DRINKING TO THE APPLE-TREES ON TWELFTH NIGHT EVE.</h3>

<p>In the eastern part of Cornwall, and in western Devonshire,
it was the custom to take a milk-panful of cider, into
which roasted apples had been broken, into the orchard.
This was placed as near the centre of the orchard as possible,
and each person, taking a “clomben” cup of the drink, goes
to different apple-trees, and addresses them as follows:—</p>

with the fragments of the roasted apples, is thrown at the

us, “In certain parts of Devonshire, the farmer, attended
by his workmen, goes to the orchard this evening; and
there, encircling one of the best bearing trees, they drink
the following toast three times:—</p>

<p>This done, they return to the house, the doors of which
they are sure to find bolted by the females, who, be the
weather what it may, are inexorable to all entreaties to open
them, till some one has guessed what is on the spit, which
is generally some nice little thing difficult to be hit on, and
is the reward of him who first names it. The doors are
then thrown open, and the lucky clodpole receives the tit-bit
as his recompense. Some are so superstitious as to believe
that if they neglect this custom, the trees will bear no apples
that year.”<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Christmas-eve was selected in some parts of England as
the occasion for wishing health to the apple-tree. Apples
were roasted on a string until they fell into a pan of spiced
ale, placed to receive them. This drink was called <i>lamb’s-wool</i>,
and with it the trees were wassailed, as in Devonshire
and Cornwall.</p>

<p>Herrick alludes to the custom:—</p>

<p>The ancient custom of providing children with a large
apple on Allhallows-eve is still observed, to a great
extent, at St Ives. “Allan-day,” as it is called, is the day of
days to hundreds of children, who would deem it a great
misfortune were they to go to bed on “Allan-night” without
the time-honoured Allan apple to hide beneath their pillows.
A quantity of large apples are thus disposed of, the sale of
which is dignified by the term Allan Market.</p>

<p>The custom, apparently a very ancient one, of putting

silver thimble are employed. These are mixed up with the
dough, and baked in the cake. At night the cake is divided.
The person who secures the sixpence will not want money
for that year; the one who has the ring will be the first
married; and the possessor of the thimble will die an old

<h3 id="heading113">OXEN PRAY ON CHRISTMAS EVE.</h3>

<p>I remember, when a child, being told that all the oxen
and cows kept at a farm, in the parish of St Germans,
at which I was visiting with my aunt, would be found on
their knees when the clock struck twelve. This is the only
case within my own knowledge of this widespread superstition
existing in Cornwall. Brand says, “A superstitious
notion prevails in the western parts of Devonshire, that at
twelve o’clock at night on Christmas-eve, the oxen in their
stalls are always found on their knees, as in an attitude of
devotion; and that, (which is still more singular,) since the
alteration of the style, they continue to do this only on the
eve of old Christmas-day. An honest countryman, living on
the edge of St Stephen’s Down, near Launceston, Cornwall,
informed me, October 28, 1790, that he once, with some
others, made a trial of the truth of the above, and, watching
several oxen in their stalls at the above time,—at twelve
o’clock at night,—they observed the two oldest oxen only, fall
upon their knees and, as he expressed it in the idiom of the
country, make ‘a cruel moan, like Christian creatures.’ I
could not, but with great difficulty, keep my countenance: he
saw, and seemed angry, that I gave so little credit to his tale;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and, walking off in a pettish humour, seemed to ‘marvel at
my unbelief.’ There is an old print of the Nativity, in which
the oxen in the stable, near the Virgin and the Child, are
represented upon their knees, as in a suppliant posture.
This graphic representation has probably given rise to the
above superstitious notion on this head.”</p>

<h3 id="heading114">“ST GEORGE”—THE CHRISTMAS PLAYS.</h3>

<p>The Christmas play is a very ancient institution in Cornwall.
At one time religious subjects were chosen, but
those gave way to romantic plays. The arrangements were
tolerably complete, and sometimes a considerable amount of
dramatic skill was displayed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">St George</span>, and the other tragic performers, are dressed out somewhat in
the style of morris-dancers, in their shirt sleeves and white trousers, much
decorated with ribbons and handkerchiefs, each carrying a drawn sword in
his hand, if they can be procured, otherwise a cudgel. They wear high
caps of pasteboard, adorned with beads, small pieces of looking-glass, coloured
paper, &amp;c.; several long strips of pith generally hang down from the
top, with small pieces of different coloured cloth strung on them: the
whole has a very smart effect.</p>

<p><i>Father Christmas</i> is personified in a grotesque manner, as an ancient
man, wearing a large mask and wig, and a huge club, wherewith he keeps
the bystanders in order.</p>

<p>The <i>Doctor</i>, who is generally the merry-andrew of the piece, is dressed
in any ridiculous way, with a wig, three-cornered hat, and painted face.</p>

<p>The other comic characters are dressed according to fancy.</p>

<p>The <i>female</i>, where there is one, is usually in the dress worn half a century
ago.</p>

<p>The <i>hobby-horse</i>, which is a character sometimes introduced, wears a
representation of a horse’s-hide.</p>

<p>Beside the regular drama of “St George,” many parties of mummers go
about in fancy dresses of every sort, most commonly the males in female
attire, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Of the Cornish mystery plays which were once acted in

say anything. The translations by Mr Norris preserve their
characteristics, which indeed differ in few respects from the
mystery plays of other parts.</p>

<p>The “Perran Round” is fortunately preserved by the proprietor

of the wealthy inhabitants of St Just to their

<h3 id="heading115">GEESE-DANCING—PLOUGH MONDAY.</h3>

<p>The first Monday after Twelfth-day is Plough Monday,
and it is the ploughman’s holiday.</p>

<p>At this season, in the Islands of Scilly, at St Ives, Penzance,
and other places, the young people exercise a sort of gallantry
called “geese-dancing.” The maidens are dressed up for young
men, and the young men for maidens; and, thus disguised,
they visit their neighbours in companies, where they dance,
and make jokes upon what has happened during the year,
and every one is humorously “told their own,” without offence
being taken. By this sort of sport, according to
yearly custom and toleration, there is a spirit of wit and
drollery kept up among the people. The music and dancing
done, they are treated with liquor, and then they go to the
next house, and carry on the same sport. A correspondent,
writing to the “Table-Book,” insists on calling these revels
“goose-dancing.” The true Cornishman never uses the
term, which is, as I have elsewhere shewn, derived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<i>dance deguiser</i>,—hence guise-dancing, or geese-dancing, by

<h3 id="heading116">CHRISTMAS AT ST IVES.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“THE GUISE-DANCING.”</p>

<p>“We doubt if there is a spot in ‘merrie England’ where
Christmas receives so hearty a welcome, and is ‘made
so much of,’ as in the old-fashioned ‘antient borough of
beloved St Ives.’ It is often said that ‘extremes meet;’
but as well might we expect the extremities of Britain—John
o’Groat’s and Cape Cornwall—to meet, as that the frolic-loving
descendants of Albion will ever imitate the cold,
mountain-nurtured Caledonians in their observance of Christmas
time. For months previous to the merry-making time,
preparations are made for the approaching ‘carnival;’ we
can assure our readers that never were the real ‘carnivals’
ushered in with greater festivities at Rome or Venice, in the
zenith of their glory, than is observed here at Christmas.
Were many of the denizens of our large towns to witness the
making up of the scores of ‘sugar-loaf,’ ‘three-cocked,’ and
indescribable-shaped hats, caps, bonnets, bloomer skirts,
leggings, jackets, &amp;c., numberless <i>et ceteras</i> of the most
grotesque and pantomimic character, colour, and shape, which
goes on in October and November, they would imagine there
was to be a <i>bal masque</i> on a large scale, or a pantomime at
‘the theatre,’ of metropolitan proportions. But not so, for
there is not even a singing class in the town, if we except the
choirs of the various congregations, and all ‘this wilful
waste’ of long cloth, scarlet, ringstraked, and speckled, is to
do honour to King Christmas during the twelve nights which
intervene ’twixt the birth of Christmas common and Christmas
proper, which said outward manifestations of honour are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
known in the neighbourhood as ‘Christmas geezze-daancing,’
or guise-dancing; but of this presently. Not only are the
‘lovers of pleasure’ on the alert, but the choirs of the
different places of worship strive to ‘get up’ a piece or two
to tickle the ears of their hearers on Christmas-night, and
the house that boasts the best ‘singing seat’ is sure to be
crammed by persons attracted by the twofold advantage of
a short sermon and a good lively tune. A pretty brisk trade
is carried on by children in the retailing unquenched lime,
in small quantities to suit the convenience of purchasers;
and few are the domiciles but have had a lick of the lime
brush, either on the wall, window-sill, door-post, or chimney.
‘A slut, indeed,’ is she declared who refuses to have a
thorough clean out before Christmas. New shoes and clothes
are worn for the first time on the great holiday; and woe betide
the unlucky Crispin who, by some unaccountable oversight,
has neglected to make Jennifer’s bran new shoes, for
her to go and see how smart the church is on Christmas-day.
As in other parts of England, a pretty large sum is spent in
evergreens, such as holly, or, as it is called here, ‘prickly
Christmas,’ bays, and laurels. Of mistletoe and cypress
there is very little in the neighbourhood, and the windows
of shops and private dwellings, as well as the parish church,
are profusely and tastefully decorated. As to provisions
there is no lack. Many a flock of geese has been bespoken,
and set apart for private customers; whilst the ears of the
grocers, who generally do a supplementary trade in swine’s
flesh, are so accustomed to receive a month’s notice for ‘a
nice bit of flea (spare) rib,’ that they are loth to engage any
of the porcine fraternity that are not all rib. The Christmas
market is not a mean affair at St Ives; if the butchers cannot
boast of many prize oxen or ‘South Downs,’ they generally
manage to make the best of their ‘home-raised’ and well-fed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
cattle, and the stalls are ‘titivated off’ nicely too. This
year, however, the inspector of nuisances, who is also market-toll
collector and police constable, sergeant, and inspector,
actually refused to clean, or allow to be cleaned, the St Ives
market on Tuesday for the Christmas-eve market, because
there was no extra tolls payable for the Christmas markets,
and, as may be expected, the epithets bestowed on him were
by no means flattering or complimentary—we did hear of a
suggestion to put the ‘gentleman’ policeman in an aldermanic
stall on the 5th of next November, or maybe during
the guise-dancing. Tradesmen have for the most part ‘cacht
their jobs,’ and the good housewife ‘done her churs in season’
on Christmas-eve. In many families, a crock of ‘fish
and tatees’ is discussed in West-Cornwall style before the
‘singers’ commence their time-honoured carol, ‘While Shepherds,’
which is invariably sung to ‘the same old tune,’ struck
by some novice in <i>u</i> flat. There is usually a host of young
men and maidens to accompany the ‘singers;’ these are composed
of the choirs of two or three dissenting bodies, who
chiefly select the members of their respective congregations
for the honour of being disturbed from a sound nap on the
eventful morning. The last two or three years the choirs have
done their carolling amongst the most respectable of the inhabitants
on the evening of Christmas-day, after divine service.</p>

<p>“On Christmas-day the mayor, aldermen, and councillors
walk in procession to church from the house of the mayor
for the time being. The church is, as we have before remarked,
gaily decked with evergreens. Two or three days
after the singers make a call ‘for something for singing,’
the proceeds, which are pretty handsome, being spent in a
substantial supper for the choir.</p>

<p>“But of the ‘guise-dancing,’ which has found a last retreat
at St Ives,—this is the only town in the country where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
old Cornish Christmas revelry is kept up with spirit. The
guise-dancing time is the twelve nights after Christmas, <i>i.e.</i>,
from Christmas-day to Twelfth-day. Guise-dancing at St
Ives is no more nor less than a pantomimic representation
or <i>bal masque</i> on an extensive scale, the performers outnumbering
the audience, who in this case take their stand
at the corners of the streets, which are but badly lighted
with gas, and rendered still more dismal of late years by
the closing of the tradesmen’s shops after sunset during this
season, on account of the noise and uproar occasioned, the
town being literally given up to a lawless mob, who go
about yelling and hooting in an unearthly manner, in a tone
between a screech and a howl, so as to render their voices
as undistinguishable as their buffoon-looking dresses. Here
a Chinese is exhibiting ‘vite mishe’ and ‘Dutch dops;’
there a turbaned Indian asks you if you ‘vant a silver vatch.’
A little further on you meet with a Highlander with ‘dops
to cure the gout.’ The home-impoverishing packman, or
duffer, has also his representative, urging to be allowed just
to leave ‘a common low-price dress at an uncommon high
price, and a quartern of his 6s. sloe-leaves, of the best quality.’
Faithless swains not unfrequently get served out by the friends
of the discarded one at this time, whilst every little peccadillo
meets with a just rebuke and exposure. About eighteen
years ago, a party of youngsters, to give more variety to the
sports, constructed a few nice representations of elephants,
horses, and—start not gentle reader—lifelike facsimiles of
that proverbially stupid brute, the ass. For several seasons
it was quite a treat to witness the antics of the self-constituted
elephants, horses, and asses, in the thoroughfares of
this little town. On the whole, the character of the guise-dancing
has degenerated very much this last twenty years.
It was formerly the custom for parties to get up a little play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and go from house to house to recite their droll oddities, and
levy contributions on their hearers in the form of cake or
plum-pudding. Wassailing, as far as I can learn, never
obtained much in this neighbourhood. Old Father Christmas
and bold King George were favourite characters. It is
not uncommon to see a most odiously-disguised person with
a bedroom utensil, asking the blushing bystanders if there
is ‘any need of me.’ Some of the dresses are, indeed, very
smart, and even costly; but for the most part they consist
of old clothes, arranged in the oddest manner, even frightfully
ugly. It is dangerous for children, and aged or infirm
persons, to venture out after dark, as the roughs generally
are armed with a sweeping brush or a shillaly. The uproar
at times is so tremendous as to be only equalled in a ‘rale
Irish row.’ As may be anticipated, these annual diversions
have a very demoralising influence on the young, on account
of the licentious nature of the conversation indulged in,
though we really wonder that there are not many more
instances of annoyance and insult than now take place, when
we consider that but for such times as Christmas and St
Ives feast, the inhabitants have no place of amusement, recreation,
or public instruction; there being no library, reading-room,
institution, literary or scientific, or evening class; and
unless there is one at the National School-room, not a night
school or even a working-men’s institution is in the town.</p>

<p>“We should not omit that one of the old customs still observed
is the giving apprentices three clear holidays (not
including Sunday) after Christmas-day, though we hear of
attempts being made to lessen this treat to the youngsters.
If we don’t wish success to these efforts, we do desire those
should succeed who will endeavour to impart to our rising
population a thorough contempt for guise-dancing and all
such unmeaning buffoonery. There is one thing which must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
not be overlooked—viz., the few drunken brawls that occur
at such times. Cases of drunkenness certainly occur, but
these are far below the average of towns of its size, the population
being in 1861 (parliamentary limits) 10,354.”—<i>St
Ives Correspondent.</i></p>

<h3 id="heading117">LADY LOVELL’S COURTSHIP.</h3>

<p>By the especial kindness of one who has a more abundant
store of old Cornish stories than any man whom I have
ever met, I am enabled to give some portion of one of the
old Cornish plays, or guise-dances. Many parts are omitted,
as they would, in our refined days, be considered coarse; but
as preserving a true picture of a peculiar people, as they
were a century and a half or two centuries since, I almost
regret the omissions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene 1.</span>—<i>The Squire’s Kitchen—Duffy sitting on the chimney-stool—Jane, the
housekeeper, half drunk, holding fast by the table.</i></p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Oh, I am very bad, I must go to bed with the wind in my stomach.
You can bake the pie, Duffy, and give the Squire his supper. Keep a good
waking fire on the pie for an hour or more. Turn the glass again; when
the sand is half down, take the fire from the kettle. Mind to have a good
blazing fire in the hall, for the Squire will be as wet as a shag. The old
fool, to stay out hunting with this flood of rain! Now, I’ll take a cup of
still waters, and crawl away to bed.</p>

<p><i>Duffy.</i> Never fear, I’ll bake the pie as well as if you were under the
kettle along with it; so go to bed, Jane.</p>

sight, and I’ll cover thee up with the furze.</p>

<p><i>H.</i> No.</p>

way of the dogs.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Give them to me, master; Jane is gone to bed. The wind from
her stomach is got up in her head, at least so she said.</p>

opened the door.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> I was driving away a great owl, master, that fell out of the ivy-bush
on the top of the chimney, and came tumbling down through the
smoke, perched hisself there on the end of the chimney-stack; there he
kept blinking and peeping, like a thing neither waking nor sleeping, till he
heard the dogs barking, when he stopped his winking, cried out, “Hoo!
hoo!” flapped his wings, and fled up the chimney the same way he came
down.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Now, master, you had better go up in the hall; you will find there
a good blazing fire.</p>

<p class="dir">[<i>The Squire examines his legs by the fire-light.</i></p>

<p><i>S.</i> Well, I declare, these are the very best stockings I ever had in my life.
I’ve been hunting, since the break of day, through the bogs and the brambles,
the furze and the thorns, in all sorts of weather; and my legs,—look,
Duffy, look—are still as dry and sound as if they had been bound up in
leather.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Then take good care of them, master; for I shall soon have a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
my own to knit for. Huey and I are thinking to get married before the
next turfey season.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> You think of having a man! a young girl like you! If I but catch
the boy Huey Lenine here, I’ll break his neck I declare. I can never
wear old Jane’s stockings any more. Why, thee dust ought to be proud to
know that the people from all over the parish, who were never to church
before in their lives, come, and from parishes round, that they may see my
fine stockings. And don’t I stop outside the church door—ay, sometimes
two hours or more—that the women may see thy fine work? Haven’t I
stopped at the cross till the parson came out to call the people in, because
he and the clerk, he said, wanted to begin?</p>

<p class="dir">[<i>The Squire places himself beside Duffy on the chimney-stool.

the oven door.</i></p>

<p>The following portion, which is the Squire’s courtship of
Duffy with the help of the devil, is a sort of duet in the old

give some idea of the way it is intended to be carried out:—</p>

<p>Another Cornish “Droll” is preserved, in part, as an
example of the kind of doggerel verse in which many of

<p>Bet of the Mill tells the Squire and company that, one
Christmas night, all the inmates of Trevider House were gone
off to a guise-dance, except Madam Pender and herself, and
that they agree to spin for pastime:—</p>

<h3 id="heading118">THE GAME OF HURLING.</h3>

<p>The game of “Hurling” was, until a recent period, played
in the parishes to the west of Penzance on the Sunday
afternoon. The game was usually between two parishes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
sometimes between Burian and Sancreed, or against St
Leven and Sennen, or the higher side of the parish played
against the lower side.</p>

<p>The run was from Burian Cross in the Church-town, to
the Pipers in Boloeit. All the gentry from the surrounding
parishes would meet at Boloeit to see the ball brought
in.</p>

<p>“Hurling matches” are peculiar to Cornwall. They are
trials of skill between two parties, consisting of a considerable
number of men, forty to sixty a side, and often between
two parishes. These exercises have their name from “hurling”
a wooden ball, about three inches in diameter, covered
with a plate of silver, which is sometimes gilt, and has commonly
a motto, “Gware wheag yeo gware teag,” “Fair play
is good play.” The success depends on catching the ball
dexterously when thrown up, or <i>dealt</i>, and carrying it off
expeditiously, in spite of all opposition from the adverse
party; or, if that be impossible, throwing it into the hands
of a partner, who, in his turn, exerts his efforts to convey it
to his own goal, which is often three or four miles’ distance.
This sport, therefore, requires a nimble hand, a quick eye,
a swift foot, and skill in wrestling; as well as strength, good
wind, and lungs. Formerly it was practised annually by
those who attended corporate bodies in surveying the bounds
of parishes; but from the many accidents that usually attended
that game, it is now scarcely ever practised. Silver
prizes used to be awarded to the victor in the games. A
correspondent at St Ives, writes:—</p>

<p>Hurling the Silver Ball.—This old custom is still observed
at St Ives. The custom is also kept up at St Columb and
St Blazey, on the anniversary of the dedication of the church.
St Ives’ feast is governed by the Candlemas-day, it being
the nearest Sunday next before that day. On the Monday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
after, the inhabitants assemble on the beach, when the ball,
which is left in the custody of the mayor for the time being,
is thrown from the churchyard to the crowd. The sides are
formed in this way,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Toms, Wills, and Jans,</div>
<div class="verse">Take off all’s on the san’s—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">that is, all those of the name of Thomas, John, or William
are ranged on one side, those of any other <i>Christian</i> name on
the other; of late years the odd names outnumber the Toms,
Wills, and Jans. There is a pole erected on the beach, and
each side strives to get the oftenest at the “goold,” <i>i.e.</i>, the
pole; the other side as manfully striving to keep them out,
and to send their opponents as great a distance from the
pole as possible. The tradition is, that the contest used
to be between the parishes of Ludgvan, Lelant, and St
Ives,—St Ives then being part of the <i>living</i> of Ludgvan,—and
that they used to have a friendly hurling at Ludgvan,
and that afterwards the contest was between Lelant and
St Ives. A stone near to Captain Perry’s house is shewn,
where the two parishes used to meet at the feast, and the
struggle was to throw the ball into the parish church,
the successful party keeping the ball, the unsuccessful
buying a new one. St Ives is said to have outnumbered
the Lelant folks, so that they gave up the contest, and the
ball was left with St Ives. Thus much is certain—that the
feasts of St Ives, Lelant, and Ludgvan fall properly on one
Sunday, though a misunderstanding has arisen, Lelant claiming
to be governed by the day before Candlemas-day, which
will alter the three every seven years.</p>

<p>The game of hurling is now but rarely played, and the
Sabbath is never broken by that or by any other game.</p>

<h3 id="heading119">SHAM MAYORS.</h3>

<h4 id="heading119a">I.—THE MAYOR OF MYLOR.</h4>

<p>There was a curious custom in the town of Penryn
in Cornwall, which long outlived all modern innovations.
On some particular day in September or October,
(I forget the exact date,) about when the hazel-nuts are ripe,
the festival of nutting-day is kept. The rabble of the town
go into the country to gather nuts, returning in the evening
with boughs of hazel in their hands, shouting and making a
great noise. In the meantime the journeymen tailors of the
town have proceeded to the adjoining village of Mylor, and
elected one of their number “Mayor of Mylor,” taking care
the selection falls on the wittiest. Seated in a chair shaded
with green boughs, and borne on the shoulders of four stalwart
men, the worthy mayor proceeds from his “good town
of Mylor” to his “ancient borough of Penryn,” the van
being led by the “body-guard” of stout fellows well armed
with cudgels,—which they do not fail to use should their path
be obstructed,—torch-bearers, and two “town serjeants,” clad
in official gowns and cocked hats, and carrying each a monstrous
cabbage on his shoulder in lieu of a mace. The rear
is brought up by the rabble of the “nutters.” About mid-day
a band of music meets them, and plays them to Penryn,
where they are received by the entire population. The procession
proceeds to the town-hall, in front of which the
mayor delivers a speech, declaratory of his intended improvements,
&amp;c., for the coming year, being generally an excellent
sarcastic burlesque on the speeches of parliamentary candidates.
The procession then moves on to each public-house
door, where the mayor, his council, and officers are liberally
supplied with liquor, and the speech is repeated with variations.
They then adjourn to the “council-chamber,” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
some public-house, and devote the night to drinking. At
night the streets are filled with people bearing torches,
throwing fireballs, and discharging rockets; and huge bonfires
are kindled on the “Green,” and “Old Wall.” The
legal mayor once made an effort to put a stop to this Saturnalia,
but his new-made brother issued prompt orders to
his body-guards, and the <i>posse comitatus</i> had to fly.</p>

<p>The popular opinion is, that there is a clause in the
borough charter compelling the legitimate mayor to surrender
his power to the “Mayor of Mylor” on the night in
question, and to lend the town sergeants’ paraphernalia to the
gentlemen of the shears.</p>

<h4 id="heading119b">II.—THE MAYOR OF ST GERMANS.</h4>

<p>One of the first objects that attracts attention on entering
the village of St Germans is the large walnut-tree, at the
foot of what is called Nut-Tree Hill. In the early part of
the present century there was a very ancient dwelling a
few yards south-east of this tree, which was supposed
to have been the residence of some ecclesiastic of former
times. Many a gay May fair has been witnessed by the
old tree; in the morning of the 28th of the month
splendid fat cattle, from some of the largest and best farms
in the county, quietly chewed the cud around its trunk; in
the afternoon the basket-swing dangled from its branches,
filled with merry laughing boys and girls from every part of
the parish. On the following day, the mock mayor, who had
been chosen with many formalities, remarkable only for their
rude and rough nature, starting from some “bush-house,”

<h4 id="heading119c">III.—THE MAYOR OF HALGAVER MOOR.</h4>

<p>The people of Bodmin had an old custom of assembling
in large numbers on Halgaver Moor in the month of July,
and electing a “Mayor of Misrule,” for the punishment of
petty offenders. Our old historian gives a quaint description.
“The youthlyer sort of Bodmin townsmen use sometimes
to sport themselves by playing the box with strangers,
whom they summon to Halgaver; the name signifieth the
Goats’ Moore, and such a place it is, lying a little without
the town, and very full of quagmires. When these mates
meet with any raw serving-man or other young master, who
may serve and deserve to make pastime, they cause him to
be solemnly arrested for his appearance before the Mayor of
Halgaver, where he is charged with wearing one spur, or
wanting a girdle, or some such like felony, and after he hath
been arraigned and tried with all requisite circumstances,
judgment is given in formal terms, and executed in some
one ungracious prank or other, more to the scorn than hurt
of the party condemned. Hence is sprung the proverb, when
we see one slovenly apparelled, to say, ‘He shall be presented
in Halgaver Court.’”</p>

<h3 id="heading120">THE FACTION FIGHT AT CURY GREAT TREE.</h3>

<p>On a green knoll in the centre of the intersection of the
roads from Helston to the Lizard, and Mawgan to Cury,
flourished an ash-tree of magnificent dimensions. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
peculiarity of its position, together with its unusual size, in
the midst of a district singularly destitute of trees, rendered
it famous throughout the surrounding neighbourhood; and in
designating a special locality, reference was, and still continues
to be, made to “Cury Great Tree,” as a position generally known.
During the last fifty years the tree has been gradually decaying,
and at present only a portion of the hollow trunk
remains, which is rapidly disappearing. It stands about
half way up a gentle rise facing the north; and in passing
over the road, the country people speak of a dim tradition of
a time when the “road ran with blood.” The occasion of
this, which is almost forgotten, was a faction fight, on a large
scale, between the men of the parishes of Wendron and
Breage, happening about a hundred years since. A wreck
took place near the Lizard, and the Wendron-men being
nearest, were soon upon the spot to appropriate whatever
flotsam and jetsam might come in their way. Returning
laden with their spoils, they were encountered at the Great
Tree by the Wendron-men bound on a similar errand, and a
fight, as a matter of course, ensued, which was prolonged till
the following day. The contest is said to have been a most
terrible one, each party being armed with staves. The
savage nature of the fight may be inferred from the following
fact:—A Wendron-man named Gluyas, having been disabled,
was put upon the top of the roadside hedge, out of
the <i>mêlée</i>, when he was seen by a Breage termagant known
as “Prudy the Wicked,” and by her quickly dragged into the
road, “Prudy” exclaiming, “Ef thee artn’t ded, I make thee,”
suiting the action to the word by striking Gluyas with her
patten iron until he was dead. There is some account of
Prudy’s having been taken before the “Justice,” but she
does not appear to have been punished. These fights between
parishes were so common in those days that any death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
occurring in the fray was quietly passed over as a thing of
course, and soon forgotten. “So late as thirty years since
it was unsafe to venture alone through the streets of the
lower part of this town (Helston) after nightfall on a market-day,
owing to the frays of the Breage, Wendron, and
Sithney men.” So writes a friend residing in Helston.</p>

<h3 id="heading121">TOWEDNACK CUCKOO FEAST.</h3>

<p>The parish feast takes place on the nearest Sunday to the
28th of April.</p>

<p>It happened in very early times, when winters extended
further into the spring than they now do, that one of the old
inhabitants resolved to be jovial notwithstanding the inclemency
of the season; so he invited all his neighbours, and to
warm his house he placed on the burning faggots the stump
of a tree. It began to blaze, and, inspired by the warmth and
light, they began to sing and drink; when, lo, with a whiz
and a whir, out flew a bird from a hollow in the stump, crying,
Cuckoo! cuckoo! The bird was caught and kept by the
farmer, and he and his friends resolved to renew the festal
meeting every year at this date, and to call it their “cuckoo
feast.” Previous to this event Towednack had no “feasten
Sunday,” which made this parish a singular exception to the
rule in Cornwall.</p>

<p>This feast is sometimes called “crowder” feast, because
the fiddler formed a procession at the church door, and led
the people through the village to some tune on his “crowd.”</p>

<h3 id="heading122">THE DUKE OF RESTORMEL.</h3>

<p>A very singular custom formerly prevailed at Lostwithiel,
in Cornwall, on Easter Sunday. The freeholders
of the town and manor having assembled together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
either in person or by their deputies, one among them,
each in his turn, gaily attired and gallantly mounted,
with a sceptre in his hand, a crown on his head, and
a sword borne before him, and respectfully attended by
all the rest on horseback, rode through the principal
street in solemn state to the church. At the churchyard
stile, the curate, or other minister, approached to
meet him in reverential pomp, and then conducted him to
church to hear divine service. On leaving the church, he
repaired, with the same pomp and retinue, to a house previously
prepared for his reception. Here a feast, suited to
the dignity he had assumed, awaited him and his suite; and,
being placed at the head of the table, he was served, kneeling,
with all the rites and ceremonies that a real prince
might expect. This ceremony ended with the dinner; the
prince being voluntarily disrobed, and descending from his
momentary exaltation, to mix with common mortals. On
the origin of this custom but one opinion can be reasonably
entertained, though it may be difficult to trace the precise
period of its commencement. It seems to have originated
in the actual appearance of the prince, who resided at
Restormel Castle in former ages; but, on the removal of
royalty, this mimic grandeur stepped forth as its shadowy
representative, and continued for many generations as a
memorial to posterity of the princely magnificence with
which Lostwithiel had formerly been honoured.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>This custom is now almost forgotten, and Lostwithiel has
little to disturb its quiet.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I cannot more appropriately preface this section,
than by quoting the remarks of a medical gentleman
in large practice, on the subject of charms:—“In
common with most of the lower classes of
the West of England, the miner is not free from many absurd
superstitions, (though I am glad to observe, even in the
last few years, a great change has taken place, and such
follies are gradually declining.) Some think themselves endowed
with a species of supernatural agency, and, like the
Egyptian alluded to by Othello, call themselves charmers,
and profess to stop the flowing of blood, (no matter from
what cause—a divided artery even,) to remove specks from
the cornea, (which, in the dialect of the country, are called
canons!) and cure erysipelas, by charming. But I have
never been able to ascertain by what means the charm is
supposed to work. I only know that it is an everyday
occurrence for mothers to bring children to the surgery,
afflicted with either of the diseases mentioned, and say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
they have had them charmed; but they were no better, such
want of improvement having obviously excited the greatest
feelings of astonishment. I knew a person connected with
the mines, who felt himself endowed with prophetic powers;
and in his case the divination was not confined to events
momentous and terrible, but extended to the most trifling
minutiæ of life.</p>

<p>“He with grave simplicity told me one day, by way of
exemplifying the proper estimation in which his prophetic
powers were held by his wife, that on one occasion, his pig
having wandered from his sty, she came to him to ascertain
in what direction it was to be sought for; and on his professing
utter ignorance of the animal’s peregrinations, she
exclaimed, in reproachful tones, ‘<i>Ah, you are not so pious
as you used to be. I remember the time when you could
have told me in an instant the exact spot to have found
it</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading124">FORTUNE-TELLING, CHARMS, ETC.</h3>

<p>In relation to this subject, and confirming an opinion already
expressed in the existence still of a belief in
magic and charms, I print the following communication
from a lady of considerable literary ability:—</p>

<p>“Every country, it may be safely inferred, has its own individual,
perhaps characteristic, Charm-record; and inquiry
into it would more than probably recompense the labour, by
the light it would let in on the still but little investigated
philosophy of the human mind, and the growth of popular
superstitions. The portion of our country best known to
the writer of these remarks is Cornwall, remarkable for the
picturesque wildness of its scenery, and not less so for its
numerous superstitions. The Rev. Charles Kingsley, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
‘Yeast,’ has availed himself, with his usual tact and power,
of one of the most striking of these, having reference to the
cruel treatment of the Jews, who were sold as slaves to work
in the mines; the evil treatment they experienced being
avenged on modern miners, by the terrors the souls of the
departed Hebrews inflicted, in returning to the scene of their
former compulsory toil, and echoing the sounds of the workmen
now labouring in flesh and blood. But this is a digression
from the main object of this article—viz., the belief in
charms. Several years ago, while residing at Falmouth, I
remember to have heard of a man in humble life, named
Thomas Martin, whose abode was said to be at a village in
the neighbourhood of Redruth, and who accomplished wonderful
cures of children subject to fits, or personally injured
by any deformity, by his power of charming. This man also
practised soothsaying to a considerable extent, and revealed,
with unquestionable accuracy, where articles mysteriously
abstracted were concealed. If a cow suddenly lost her milk,
whether witchcraft had exerted its malignant influence on
the non-producing animal or no, such a personage could not
but exercise an important power over the rustic population
of the neighbourhood. But belief in the mysterious intelligence
of Martin was by no means confined to the peasant
class. A highly-respected and even ladylike person told the
writer, with all the gravity becoming such a communication,
that she had once made an appointment with Thomas Martin
to meet him at a certain stile, for the purpose of receiving
from him the prediction of her future lot,—in other words,
having her fortune told; and hastening thither at the time
appointed, was horrified to find the stile occupied by a large
black snake. As Martin did not make his appearance, she
inferred that he had assumed the serpent form, and not
being disposed to hold any intercourse with a being of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
questionable exterior, she hastened away, determined never
more to risk the attainment of the knowledge she coveted
through a probably diabolic channel.</p>

<p>“This anecdote is given as veritable experience of the belief
which may prevail in a mind fairly intelligent, and generally
rational in conducting the ordinary business of life.</p>

<p>“Martin’s reputation was disputed by no one, and that it
continued unimpaired to the close of his life reflects no inconsiderable
credit on the shrewdness and sagacity of his
mind and his power of guessing.</p>

<p>“In the town where the writer has been residing for the
last four months, there is a female, advanced in years and of
good character, who, according to the report of many persons,—one
a relative of her own,—is peculiarly endowed with
the power of charming away the disease called the “kennel,”
an affection of the eye, which causes extreme pain. A
young lady’s father was one evening suffering severe pain in
the right eye, and after trying various remedies without
effect, (the agony having greatly increased,) in her despair
she sought an occasion to leave the house, and hastened at
once to the abode of the charmer. She told her errand to
the woman, who said that many had come to her for the
purpose of ridiculing her, and she did not like to say anything
about charming—she did not wish to be laughed at.
On this the young lady assured her that her object in true
faith was to obtain relief for her suffering father, and by no
means to indulge the spirit of ridicule. On this representation
she was satisfied, and desired to know the <i>kind</i> of kennel
which affected the gentleman’s eye. This information the
daughter was unable to give her, being unacquainted with
their peculiarities; ‘because,’ said the charmer, ‘there are
nine kinds of kennels,’ intimating at the same time that a
different charm might be said or applied to each,—so that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to avoid omitting any, she must say the charms for all, in
order that the one especially affecting the diseased eye should
be certainly included in the charm. She went up-stairs, and
remained about half an hour. On her return she addressed
the young lady, and told her she might go home, where she
would learn whether the eye had been relieved. She took
no money for her incantation. Any little present might be
offered at a subsequent visit, but no direct payment was
ever requested, and indeed would have been declined. The
amazement and pleasure of the anxious daughter, on her
arrival at home, will be imagined, on learning from her father
that the intense pain in the eye had ceased during her absence,
though he had not been made acquainted with her
errand. The influence of the faith of another, in this case,
on the relief of the afflicted person, has no verisimilitude save
with that of the father of the demoniac in the gospel, or the
removal of the son’s fever in consequence of the faith of the
father. I have no reason whatever to question the truth of
this story, which was confirmed by the wife of the gentleman
thus relieved.</p>

<p>“A still more curious instance of the effect of charm, though
quite of another character, was related to me by the same
party. The gentleman referred to being much afflicted with
cramp, his wife was earnestly advised, by a country woman
to whom she mentioned the circumstance, to request her
husband to place his slippers, with the toes turned upward,
at the foot of the bed. Half smiling at the wise counsel,
yet perhaps not altogether incredulous, he followed the good
woman’s advice, and to his great comfort found himself unaffected
by his dreaded enemy throughout the night. His
faith being thus established in the <i>anti-cramp</i> influence of
upturned slippers, he took care to place them, or to have
them placed, in the prescribed attitude on several successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
nights. One night, however, he was again seized with some
appalling twinges, and bethinking himself of the cause, suddenly
recollected that in hastening into bed he had not
observed the important rule; instantly he had the slippers
restored to their proper position, and, to his astonishment
and delight, the pain ceased, and visited him no more. After
this experience of the wonderful effects that followed so
simple a specific, it may be easily imagined that he did not
again risk the return of the cramp from neglecting it. Such
phenomena seem beyond the power of explanation on any
known medical principles. If any one more than usually
versed in the subtle power exercised on the body by the
mind, can throw light on the <i>slipper</i> cure of the cramp, he
will deserve much at the hands of physiological and mental
science.”</p>

<p class="right">S. E. M.</p>

<h3 id="heading125">THE ZENNOR CHARMERS.</h3>

<p>Both men and women in this parish possessed this power
to a remarkable degree. They could stop blood, however
freely it might be flowing. “Even should a pig be
sticked in the very place, if a charmer was present, and
<i>thought</i> of his charm at the time, the pig would not bleed.”
This statement, made by a Zennor-man, shews a tolerably
large amount of faith in their power. The charmers are very
cautious about communicating their charms. A man would
not on any account tell his charm to a woman, or a woman
communicate hers to a man. People will travel many miles
to have themselves or their children charmed for “wildfires,”
(erysipelas,) ringworms, pains in the limbs or teeth, “kennels”
on the eyes, (ulcerations.) A correspondent writes me:—“Near
this lives a lady charmer, on whom I called. I
found her to be a really clever, sensible woman. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
reading a learned treatise on ancient history. She told me
there were but three charmers left in the west,—one at New
Mill, one in Morva, and herself.” Their charm for stopping
blood is but another version of one given on another page.</p>

<h3 id="heading126">J—— H——, The Conjurer of St Colomb.</h3>

<p>This old man was successful in persuading his dupes that
he owed his powers over evil spirits to his superior
learning and his unblemished life. This assumption of piety
was well preserved, and to the outside world his sanctity was
undoubted. The only practice which can be named as peculiar
to H—— was that of lighting scores of candles and placing
them around the meadow near his house. Of course such a
display would attract much attention; and J—— succeeded in
conveying an impression to the minds of the country people
that this process was required to counteract the spells of the
witches. When this old fellow has been summoned, as he
often was, to the houses supposed to be under the influence
of evil, or to be bewitched, his practice was not a little
original, though wanting in all that dignifies the office of an
exorcist. When he arrived at the house, before speaking to
any one, he would commence operations by beating with a
heavy stick on the wooden partitions, screens, or pieces of
furniture, so as to make the greatest possible noise, shouting
loudly all the time, “Out! out! out!—Away! away! away!—to
the Red Sea—to the Red Sea—to the Red Sea.” Frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
he would add, with violent enunciation and much
action, a torrent of incoherent and often incomprehensible
words, (locally, “<i>gibberish</i>.”) The proceeding being brought
to a close, and the spirits of evil flown, every part of the
house was ordered to be well cleansed, and the walls and ceilings
to be thoroughly lime-washed,—certainly the only
sensible part of the whole operation. When J—— H——
was applied to respecting stolen property, his usual practice
was to shew the face of the thief in a tub of water. J——
drove a considerable trade in selling powders to throw over
bewitched cattle.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading127">CURES FOR WARTS.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The vicar of Bodmin found, not long since, a bottle full
of pins laid in a newly-made grave. I have heard of
this as an unfailing remedy; each wart was touched with a
new pin, and the pin then dropped into the bottle. I am
not quite certain that it was necessary that the bottle should
be placed in a newly-made grave; in many cases burying it in
the earth, and especially at a “four cross-roads,” was quite
sufficient. As the pins rust, the warts decay.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>A piece of string should be taken, and as many knots tied
on it as there are warts on the body; each wart being carefully
touched with the knot dedicated to it. The string is
then to be buried, and the warts fade away as it decays. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
few years since a shipwright in Devonport dockyard professed
to cure warts by merely receiving from an indifferent
person a knotted string,—the knots of which had been tied
by the afflicted. What he did with the string I know not.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>To touch each wart with a pebble, place the pebbles in a
bag, and to lose the bag on the way to church, was for many
years a very favourite remedy; but the unfortunate person
who found the bag received the warts. A lady once told
me that she picked up such a bag, when a child, and out of
curiosity, and in ignorance, examined the contents. The
result was that she had, in a short time, as many warts as
there were stones in the bag.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>Another remedy was to <i>steal</i> a piece of meat from a
butcher’s stall in the public market, and with this to touch
the warts, and bury it. As the meat putrefied the warts
decayed.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p>I remember, when quite a child, having a very large
“seedy wart” on one of my fingers. I was taken by a distant
relation, an elderly lady, residing in Gwinear, to some
old woman, for the purpose of having this wart charmed. I
well remember that two charred sticks were taken from the
fire on the hearth, and carefully crossed over the fleshy
excrescence, while some words were muttered by the charmer.
I know not how long it was before the wart disappeared, but
certainly, at some time, it did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading128">A CURE FOR PARALYSIS.</h3>

<p>Margery Penwarne, a paralysed woman, about
fifty years of age, though from her affliction looking
some ten years older, sat in the church porch of St ——,
and presented her outstretched withered arm and open palm
to the congregation as they left the house of God after the
morning service.</p>

<p>Penny after penny fell into her hand, though Margery
never opened her lips. All appeared to know the purpose,
and thirty pennies were speedily collected. Presently the
parson came with his family, and then she spoke for the first
time, soliciting the priest to change the copper coins into one
silver one. This wish was readily acceded to, and the paralytic
woman hobbled into the church, and up the aisle to the
altar rails. A few words passed between her and the clerk;
she was admitted within the rails, and the clerk moved the
communion-table from against the wall, that she might walk
round it, which she did three times.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Margery, “with God’s blessing, I shall be cured;
my blessed bit of silver must be made into a ring,” (this was
addressed to the clerk, half aside;) “and within three weeks
after it is on my finger I shall get the use of my limbs again.”</p>

<p>This charm is common throughout the three western
counties for the cure of rheumatism,—the Devonshire halt,—or
for any contraction of the limbs.</p>

came to him some time since for water from the font
after a christening; she required it to undo some spell. The
vicar states, that all the fonts in the country were formerly
locked, to prevent people from stealing the “holy water,” as
they called it.</p>

<h3 id="heading140">THE CURE OF BOILS.</h3>

<p>The holed stone—Mên-an-tol—in Lanyon, is commonly

sufferer was drawn nine times against the sun—or, if a man,
he was to crawl through the hole nine times.</p>

<p>Strumous children were not unfrequently treated after
another fashion.</p>

<p>A young ash-tree was cleft vertically, and the parts being
drawn forcibly asunder, the child was passed “three times
three times” against the sun through the tree. This ceremony
having been performed, the tree was carefully bound
together: if the bark grew together and the tree survived,
the child would grow healthy and strong; if the tree died,
the death of the child, it was believed, would surely follow.</p>

<h3 id="heading142">THE CLUB-MOSS, (LYCOPODIUM INUNDATUM.)</h3>

<p>If this moss is properly gathered, it is “good against all

by which they may be guided.</p>

is to be cut kneeling. It is to be carefully wrapped in
a white cloth, and subsequently boiled in some water taken
from the spring nearest to its place of growth. This may be
used as a fomentation. Or the club-moss may be made into
an ointment, with butter made from the milk of a new cow.</p>

<h3 id="heading143">MOON SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>

<p>The following superstitions are still prevalent on the north
coast of Cornwall:—</p>

<p>“This root, (the sea-poppy,) so much valued for removing
all pains in the breast, stomach, and intestines, is good also
for disordered lungs, and is so much better here than in
other places, that the apothecaries of Cornwall send hither
for it; and some people plant them in their gardens in Cornwall,
and will not part with them under sixpence a root. A
very simple notion they have with regard to this root, which
falls not much short of the Druids’ superstition in gathering
and preparing their selago and samolus. This root, you must
know, is accounted very good both as an emetic and cathartic.
If, therefore, they design that it shall operate as the former,
their constant opinion is that it should be scraped and sliced
upwards—that is, beginning from the root, the knife is to
ascend towards the leaf;—but if that it is intended to operate
as a cathartic, they must scrape the root downwards. The
<i>senecio</i> also, or groundsel, they strip upwards for an emetic
and downwards for a cathartic. In Cornwall they have
several such groundless opinions with regard to plants, and
they gather all the medicinal ones when the moon is just
such an age; which, with many other such whims, must be
considered as the reliques of the Druid superstition.”<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>They, the Druids, likewise used great ceremonies in gathering
an herb called <i>samolus</i>, marsh-wort, or fen-berries, which
consisted in a previous fast, in not looking back during the
time of their plucking it, and, lastly, in using their left hand
only; from this last ceremony, perhaps, the herb took the
name of <i>samol</i>, which, in the Phœnician tongue, means the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
left hand. This herb was considered to be particularly
efficacious in curing the diseases incident to swine and
cattle.—(<i>C. S. Gilbert.</i>)</p>

<h3 id="heading144">CURES FOR WHOOPING-COUGH.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>Gather nine spar stones from a running stream, taking
care not to interrupt the free passage of the water in
doing so. Then dip a quart of water from the stream, which
must be taken in the direction in which the stream runs;—by
no means must the vessel be dipped against the stream.</p>

<p>Then make the nine stones red hot, and throw them into
the quart of water. Bottle the prepared water, and give the
afflicted child a wine-glass of this water for nine mornings
following. If this will not cure the whooping-cough, nothing
else can, says the believer.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>A female donkey of three years old was taken, and the
child was drawn naked nine times over its back and under
its belly. Then three spoonfuls of milk were drawn from the
teats of the animal, and three hairs cut from the back and
three hairs cut from the belly were placed in it. This was
to stand for three hours to acquire the proper virtue, and
then the child drank it in three doses.</p>

<p>This ceremony was repeated three mornings running, and
my informant said the child was always cured. I knew of
several children who were treated in this manner in one of
the small villages between Penzance and Madron Church-town,
some twenty or thirty years since. There were some
doggerel lines connected with the ceremony, which have
escaped my memory, and I have endeavoured, in vain, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
find any one remembering them. They were to the effect
that, as Christ placed the cross on the ass’s back when He
rode into Jerusalem, and so rendered the animal holy, if the
child touched where Jesus sat, it should cough no more.</p>

<h3 id="heading145">CURE OF TOOTHACHE.</h3>

<p>One good man informed me that, though he had no faith
in charming, yet this he knew, that he was underground
one day, and had the toothache “awful bad, sure enough;
and Uncle John ax’d me, ‘What’s the matter?’ says he.
‘The toothache,’ says I. ‘Shall I charm it?’ says he.
‘Ees,’ says I. ‘Very well,’ says he; and off he went to work
in the next pitch. Ho! dedn’t my tooth ache, Lor’ bless ee;
a just ded ye knaw; just as if the charm were tugging my
very life out. At last Uncle John comed down to the soller,
and sing’d out, ‘Alloa! how’s your tooth in there?’ says he.
‘Very bad,’ says I. ‘How’s a feeling?’ says he. ‘Pulling
away like an ould hoss with the “skwitches,”’ says I. ‘Hal
drag my jaw off directly,’ says I. ‘Ees the charm working?’
says he. ‘Es, a shure enuf,’ says I. ‘Es,’ says he, ‘al be
better d’rectly.’ ‘Hope a will,’ says I. Goodness gracious!
dedn’t a ache; I believe a did you; then a stopped most to
once. ‘Es better,’ says I. ‘I thought so,’ says he; ‘and
you waan’t have un no more for a long time,’ says he. ‘Thank
ee, Uncle John,’ says I; ‘I’ll give ee a pint o’ beer pay-day,’ and
so I ded; an’ I haben’t had the toothache ever since. Now, if
he dedn’t charm un, how ded a stop? and if he dedn’t knaw
a would be better a long time, how ded he say so? No, nor
I haven’t had un never since. So that’s a plain proof as he
knaw’d all about it, waden’t a you?”</p>

<p>I nodded assent, convinced it was useless to argue against
such reasoning as that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading146">THE CONVALESCENT’S WALK.</h3>

<p>If an invalid goes out for the first time and makes a circuit,
this circuit must be with the sun; if against the
sun, there will be a relapse.</p>

<h3 id="heading147">ADDERS, AND THE MILPREVE.</h3>

<p>The country people around the Land’s-End say that in old
times no one could live in the low grounds, which
were then covered with thickets, and these swarming with
adders. Even at a much later period, in the summer-time,
it was not safe to venture amongst the furze on the Downs
without a <i>milpreve</i>. (I have never seen a milpreve; but it is
described to me as being about the size of a pigeon’s egg,
and I am told that it is made by the adders when they get
together in great numbers. Is it not probable that the milpreve
may be one of the madrepore corals—<i>millepore</i>—found
sometimes on the beaches around Land’s-End?)</p>

<p>A friend writes me:—“I was once shewn a milpreve; it
was nothing more than a beautiful ball of coralline limestone,
the section of the coral being thought to be entangled
young snakes.”</p>

<p>When some old men were streaming the “Bottoms” up
near Partimey, they were often obliged to leave work on
account of the number of adders that would get together
as if by agreement, and advance upon them.</p>

<p>One day one of the tin streamers chanced to leave his pot
of milk, uncovered, out of the moor-house, when an adder got
into it. The man cut a turf and put over the pot to prevent
the reptile from escaping. In a few minutes the tinners
saw “the ugly things crawling and leaping from all
quarters towards the pot.” The streamers were obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
run, and take which way they would; the adders seemed to
be coming from every direction, further and further off.</p>

<p>At last “they formed a heap round the pot as large as a
pook [cock] of hay.” Towards night all the reptiles were
quite still, then the men gathered together, around the mass
of adders, a great quantity of furze, (being summer, there was
plenty cut and dry close at hand,) and piled it up like sheaves
to make a mow, laying a circle of well-dried turf without it.
They then fired the turf on every side, and when it was well
ignited, they fired the furze. “Oh, it was a sight to see the
adders when they felt the smoke and the flame! they began to
boil, as it were, all in a heap, and fell back into the flaming
furze; those which leaped through perishing on the brilliant
ring of burning peat. Thus were killed thousands upon
thousands of adders, and the moors were clear for a long,
long period.”</p>

<p>This is related nearly as the story was told; but it appears
necessary to make some allowance for that spirit of exaggeration
which is a characteristic of all Celtic people, ere they
have been tutored to know the dignity of truth.</p>

<p>“The country people retaine a conceite, that the snakes, by
their breathing upon a hazel-wand, doe make a stone ring of
blew colour, in which there appeareth the yellow figure of a
snake, and that beasts which are stung, being given to drink
of the water wherein this stone hath bene socked, will there-through
recover.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>This was clearly one of the so-called “Druidic rings,”—examples
of which may be seen in our museums,—which
have been found in England and in Ireland. It is curious
that at the glassworks of Murano, near Venice, they still
make rings, or beads, precisely resembling the ancient ones,
and these are used largely as money in Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Snakes were formerly held in great reverence; and Camden
asserts that one of the prevailing superstitions concerning
them was that, about midsummer-eve, they all met together
in companies, and, joining their heads, began a general hiss,
which they continued until a kind of bubble was formed,
which immediately hardened, and gave to the finder prosperity
in all his undertakings.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Lhuyd, in a letter written in 1701, gives a curious account
of the then superstitious character of the people in this district.
“The Cornish retain variety of charms, and have still
towards the Land’s-End the amulets of <i>Maen Magal</i> and
<i>Glain-neider</i>, which latter they call a <i>Melprer</i>, a thousand
worms, and have a charm for the snake to make it, when
they have found one asleep, and struck a hazel-wand in
the centre of its <i>spiræ</i>.” Camden mentions the use of snake-stones
as a Cornish superstition.</p>

<p>“The very same story, in fact, is told of the <i>Adder-stane</i>
in the popular legends of the Scottish Lowlands, as Pliny
records of the origin of the <i>Ovum Anguinum</i>. The various
names by which these relics are designated all point to their
estimation as amulets or superstitious charms; and the fact
of their occurrence, most frequently singly, in the sepulchral
cist or urn, seems to prove that it was as such, and not
merely as personal ornaments, that they were deposited with
the ashes of the dead. They are variously known as adder-beads,
serpent-stones, Druidical beads; and, amongst the
Welsh and Irish, by the synonymous terms of <i>Gleini na
Droedh</i> and <i>Glaine nan Druidhe</i>, signifying the magician’s
or Druid’s glass.”—<i>Wilson’s Archæology and Prehistoric
Annals of Scotland</i>, p. 304.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading148">SNAKES AVOID THE ASH-TREE.</h3>

<p>It is said that no kind of snake is ever found near the
“ashen-tree,” and that a branch of the ash-tree will prevent
a snake from coming near a person.</p>

<p>A child, who was in the habit of receiving its portion of
bread and milk at the cottage door, was found to be in the
habit of sharing its food with one of the poisonous adders.
The reptile came regularly every morning, and the child,
pleased with the beauty of his companion, encouraged the
visits. The babe and adder were close friends.</p>

<p>Eventually this became known to the mother, and, finding
it to be a matter of difficulty to keep the snake from the
child whenever it was left alone,—and she was frequently,
being a labourer in the fields, compelled to leave her child to
shift for itself,—she adopted the precaution of binding an
“ashen-twig” about its body.</p>

<p>The adder no longer came near the child; but from that
day forward the child pined, and eventually died, as all
around said, through grief at having lost the companion by
whom it had been fascinated.</p>

<h3 id="heading149">TO CHARM A SNAKE.</h3>

<p>When an adder or snake is seen, a circle is to be rapidly
drawn around it, and the sign of the cross made
within it, while the two first verses of the 68th Psalm are
repeated:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate
him flee before him.</p>

<p>“As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before
the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.”</p>

</div>

<p>When a child, I well remember being shewn a snake, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
yet dead, within a circle of this kind; the gardener who
drew my attention to the reptile informing me that he had
charmed it in the manner related.</p>

<h3 id="heading150">THE ASH-TREE.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></h3>

<p>Weakly children—“children that wouldn’t goode,” or
thrive—were sometimes drawn through the cleft ash-tree.
I have seen the ceremony performed but in one case.</p>

<p>The tree was young, and it was taken by the two forks,—bifurcation
having taken place,—and by force rended longitudinally.
The cleft was kept open, and the child, quite
naked, was passed head first through the tree nine times.
The tree was then closed and carefully tied together. If the
severed parts reunited, the child and the tree recovered together;
if the cleft gaped in any part, the operation was
certain to prove ineffectual.</p>

<p>I quote another example. A large knife was inserted
into the trunk of the young tree, about a foot from the
ground, and a vertical rending made for about three feet.
Two men then forcibly pulled the parts asunder, and held
them so, whilst the mother passed the child through it three
times. This “passing” alone was not considered effective;
it was necessary that the child should be washed for three
successive mornings in the dew from the leaves of the
“charmed ash.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Athenæum</i> for September 1846, Ambrose Merton—Mr Thoms—has
some interesting notices of the widespread
belief in, and the antiquity of, this superstition.</p>

<h3 id="heading152">A TEST OF INNOCENCY.</h3>

<p>A farmer in Towednack having been robbed of some
property of no great value, was resolved, nevertheless,
to employ a test which he had heard the “old people” resorted
to for the purpose of catching the thief. He invited
all his neighbours into his cottage, and when they were assembled,
he placed a cock under the “brandice,” (an iron
vessel formerly much employed by the peasantry in baking,
when this process was carried out on the hearth, the fuel
being furze and ferns.) Every one was directed to touch the
brandice with his, or her, third finger, and say, “In the name
of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, speak.” Every one did
as they were directed, and no sound came from beneath the
brandice. The last person was a woman, who occasionally
laboured for the farmer in his fields. She hung back, hoping
to pass unobserved amidst the crowd. But her very anxiety
made her a suspected person. She was forced forward, and
most unwillingly she touched the brandice, when, before she
could utter the words prescribed, the cock crew. The woman
fell faint on the floor, and, when she recovered, she confessed
herself to be the thief, restored the stolen property, and became,
it is said, “a changed character from that day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading153">THE BONFIRE TEST.</h3>

<p>A bonfire is formed of faggots of furze, ferns, and the
like. Men and maidens by locking hands form a
circle, and commence a dance to some wild native song.
At length, as the dancers become excited, they pull each
other from side to side across the fire. If they succeed in
treading out the fire without breaking the chain, none of the
party will die during the year. If, however, the ring is
broken before the fire is extinguished, “bad luck to the weak
hands,” as my informant said.</p>

<h3 id="heading154">LIGHTS SEEN BY THE CONVERTED.</h3>

<p>There is, in many parts of the county, a belief, derived
no doubt from the recollection of St Paul’s conversion,
that, when sinners are converted, they see shining lights
about themselves. I have many times heard this, but every
one seems to have his own particular mode of describing the
phenomenon,—where they can be prevailed on to describe it
at all,—and usually that is derived from some picture which
has made an impression on their minds: such as, “exactly
like the light shining round the angel appearing to St Peter,
in fayther’s Bible.”</p>

<h3 id="heading155">THE MIGRATORY BIRDS</h3>

<p>I find a belief still prevalent amongst the people in the
outlying districts of Cornwall, that such birds as the
cuckoo and the swallow remain through the winter in deep
caves, cracks in the earth, and in hollow trees; and instances
have been cited of these birds having been found in a torpid
state in the mines, and in hollow pieces of wood. This belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
appears to be of some antiquity, for Carew writes in his
“Survey of Cornwall” as follows:—</p>

<p>“In the west parts of Cornwall, during the winter season,
swallows are found sitting in old deep tynne-works, and
holes in the sea cliffes: but touching their lurking-places,
<i>Olaus Magnus</i> maketh a far stranger report. For he saith
that in the north parts of the world, as summer weareth out,
they clap mouth to mouth, wing to wing, and legge to legge,
and so, after a sweet singing, fall downe into certain lakes or
pools amongst the caves, from whence at the next spring
they receive a new resurrection; and he addeth, for proofe
thereof, that the fishermen who make holes in the ice, to
dip up such fish in their nets as resort thither for breathing,
doe sometimes light on these swallows congealled in clods, of
a slymie substance, and that, carrying them home to their
stoves, the warmth restored them to life and flight.”</p>

<p>A man employed in the granite quarries near Penryn, informed
me that he found such a “slymie substance” in one
of the pools in the quarry where he was working, that he
took it home, warmth proved it to be a bird, but when it
began to move it was seized by the cat, who ran out on the
downs and devoured it.</p>

<h3 id="heading156">SHOOTING STARS.</h3>

<p>A mucilaginous substance is found on the damp ground
near the granite quarries of Penryn, this is often very
phosphorescent at night. The country people regard this as
the substance of shooting stars. A tradesman of Penryn
once brought me a bottle full of this substance for analysis,
informing me that the men employed at the quarries, whenever
they observed a shooting star, went to the spot near
which they supposed it to fall, and they generally found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
hat full of this mucus. It is curious that the Belgian
peasants also call it “the substance of shooting stars,”
(“Phosphorescence,” p. 109. By T. L. Phipson.) This author
says, “I have sketched the history of this curious substance
in the <i>Journal de Médecine et de Pharmacologie</i> of
Bruxelles, for 1855. It was analysed chemically by Mulder,
and anatomically by Carus, and from their observations appears
to be the peculiar mucus which envelops the eggs of
the frog. It swells to an enormous volume when it has free
access to water. As seen upon the damp ground in spring,
it was often mistaken for some species of fungus; it is, however,
simply the spawn of frogs, which has been swallowed
by some large crows or other birds, and afterwards vomited,
from its peculiar property of swelling to an immense size in
their bodies.”</p>

<p>In Mulder’s account of its chemical composition, given
by Berselius in his <i>Rapport Annual</i>, he distinguishes it by
designation of <i>mucilage atmosphérique</i>.</p>

<h3 id="heading157">THE SUN NEVER SHINES ON THE PERJURED.</h3>

<p>There appears to exist a very old superstition, to the
effect that when a man has deeply perjured himself,—especially
if by his perjury he has sacrificed the life of a
friend,—he not merely loses the enjoyment of the sunshine,
but he actually loses all consciousness of its light or its
warmth. Howsoever bright the sun may shine, the weather
appears to him gloomy, dark, and cold.</p>

<p>I have recently been told of a man living in the western
part of Cornwall, who is said to have sworn away the life of
an innocent person. “The face of this false witness is the
colour of one long in the tomb; and he has never, since the
death of the victim of his forswearing, seen the sun.” It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
must be remembered the perjured man is not blind. All
things around him are seen as by other men, but the sense
of vision is so dulled that the world is for ever to him in a
dark, vapoury cloud.</p>

<h3 id="heading158">CHARACTERISTICS.</h3>

<p>An esteemed and learned correspondent, himself a Cornishman,
writing to me on the Cornish character, says:—</p>

<p>“There are some adages in which beadledom receives
various hard knocks—that abstraction mostly taking the shape
of some unlucky mayor; and I have heard in Cornwall, but
never elsewhere, that the greatest fool in the place for the
time being is always made the mayor.</p>

<p>“There is an adage of the Mayor of Calenich, (and yet I
doubt if ever that hamlet had such an officer.) Calenich is
one mile from Truro, and the mayor’s hackney was pastured
two miles from home; so, as his worship would by no means
compromise his dignity by walking to Truro, he invariably
walked to his horse to ride there, so that it was said of any
one who would keep up appearances at great trouble, that he
was ‘<i>like the Mayor of Calenich, who walked two miles to
ride one</i>.’</p>

<p>“The class who never know on which side their bread is
buttered, are said to be ‘<i>like the Mayor of Market-Jew,
sitting in their own light</i>;’ and the stupid man whose
moods, whether of sadness or merriment, are inopportune, is,
as may be, said to be ‘<i>like the Mayor of Falmouth, who
thanked God when the town-jail was enlarged</i>.’</p>

<p>“Many persons are chronicled in the same manner.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Like Nicholas Kemp, he’s got occasion for all.</i>’
Nicholas was said to be a voter in a Cornish borough, who
was told to help himself (so that no one should have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
him a bribe,) from a table covered with gold, in the election
committee-room. Taking off his hat, he swept the whole
mass into it, saying, ‘I’ve occasion for all.’</p>

<p>“‘<i>Like Uncle Acky Stoddern, the picture of ill luck.</i>’
This was always applied to a once well-known Gwennap-man.</p>

<p>“When a boy is asked what he will be, it is sometimes
answered on his behalf, ‘<i>I’ll be like Knuckey, be as I am</i>.’</p>

<p>“‘<i>Like Nanny Painter’s hens, very high upon the legs</i>,’
is applied to a starveling or threadpaper.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Like Malachi’s cheeld, choke-full of sense</i>,’ applied
derisively to any one boasting of himself or of his children.
This is, I believe, purely Cornish.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Like a toad under a harrow, I don’t know whichee
corse to steer.</i>’ The first division of this adage is common
property, the last is confined to Cornwall.</p>

<p>“‘<i>He is coming home with Penny Liggan</i>,’ sometimes
‘Peter Lacken,’ signifies the return of a pennyless scapegrace.
The term was probably ‘penny lacking’ originally.</p>

<p>“Are the Cornish folk given to making ‘bulls,’ like the
Irish?” asks my correspondent. “I have heard of one or two
curious inversions of speech.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time a little boy having vainly importuned
his seniors for a penny to go and buy sweets, being determined
not to be disappointed, went off, exclaiming, ‘I don’t
care; I’ll go and <i>trust</i> Betty Rule,’ (the sweetmeat vendor.)
This is native and genuine Gwennapian.</p>

<p>“The common people are fond of figures of speech. Port-wine
negus was christened by the miners ‘black wine toddy.’
They go on Midsummer-day to Falmouth or Penzance, to get
‘<i>a pen’ord o’ say</i>’—that is, they go out in a boat on payment
of a penny.</p>

<p>“With them, when their health is inquired after, every
man is ‘<i>brave</i>,’ and every woman ‘<i>charming</i>;’ and friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
takes dear household names into its mouth for more expressiveness.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Billy, my son, how’s faether?’</p>

<p>“‘Brave, thank ee.’</p>

<p>“‘How are you, Coden [Cousin] Jaan, and how’s Betty?’</p>

<p>“‘She’s charming, thank ee.’</p>

<p>“<i>Trade</i> is a word of special application, ‘<i>a pa’cel o’ trade</i>.’</p>

<p>“A precious mess is ‘<i>a brave shape</i>.’</p>

<p>“Of an undecided person it is said, ‘<i>He is neither Nim nor
Doll</i>.’ Does this mean he is neither Nimrod nor Dorothy?</p>

<p>“A phrase descriptive of vacuity of expression is, ‘<i>He
looks like anybody that has neither got nor lost</i>.’”</p>

<p>Years since it was a common custom to assign some ridiculous
action to the people of a small town or village. For
example, the people of one place were called “Buccas,” “because
some one of them was frightened at his shadow.”</p>

<p>Those of another town were named “Gulls,” “because two
of the townsmen threw a gull over a cliff to break its neck.”</p>

<p>The men of a fishing-village were nicknamed “Congers,”
“because they threw a conger overboard to drown it.”</p>

<p>“Who whipped the hake?” was applied to the inhabitants
of another town, because hake, it is said, being excessively
plenty, the fishermen flogged one of those fish, and flung it
back into the sea; upon which all the hakes left that coast,
and kept away for years.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>“Who drowned the man in a dry ditch?” belongs especially
to another place.</p>

<p>Certain Cornishmen built a wall around the cuckoo, to
prevent that bird from leaving the county, and thus to insure
an early spring. When built, the bird flew out, crying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
“Cuckoo! cuckoo!” “If we had put one course more on
the wall we should a’ kept’n in,” said they.</p>

<p>Camborne is so called from <i>Camburne</i>, <i>a crooked well-pit</i>
of water. This crooked well was at one time far famed for
the cure of many diseases.</p>

<p>The persons who washed in this well were called <i>Merrasicke</i>.
I know not the meaning of the word. According
to an old Cornish custom of fixing nicknames on people,
the inhabitants of Camborne are called <i>Mearageeks</i>, signifying
perverse, or obstinate.—(<i>Lanyon.</i>)</p>

<p>The Church was anciently called <i>Mariadoci</i>. I therefore
suspect that the above terms have some connexion
with this name. By an easy corruption, and the addition
of <i>geeks</i>, or <i>gawks</i>, (meaning awkward,) either word can be
produced.</p>

<p>Of the Gorran men it is asked, “Who tried to throw the
moon over the cliffs?”</p>

<h3 id="heading159">THE MUTTON FEAST.</h3>

<p>An old tradition—the particulars of which I have failed to
recover—says that a flock of sheep were blown from
the Gwithian Sands over into St Ives Bay, and that the St
Ives fishermen caught them,—believing them to be a new
variety of fish,—either in their nets, or with hook and line,
and brought them ashore as their night’s catch.</p>

<p>I learn that Mr Fortescue Hitchins, some fifty or sixty
years since, wrote a “copy of verses” on this tradition, but I
have never seen this production.</p>

<h3 id="heading160">THE FLOATING GRINDSTONE.</h3>

<p>I have already told of St Piran and his grindstone. I
have, however, another and a more modern story, which
is told with great glee at some of the social meetings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
fishermen. This is given merely to indicate the simplicity of
this honest race.</p>

<p>A party was got together on a promontory at the extremity
of the bay which enclosed a fishing-town. They
were gathered to see a wonder, a <i>floating grindstone</i>. Seeing
that grindstones were grindstones in those days, and worth
many pounds sterling, a boat was manned, and away they
went, the mover of the expedition being in the bow of the boat.</p>

<p>As they approached the grindstone, this man planted his
foot on the gunwale, ready for a spring. They were close
aboard the circular mass,—“All my own, and none for nobody,”
he cries, and sprang off, as he fancied, on to the grindstone.
Lo! to his great surprise, he sank under water, presently
popping up again within his charmed circle, to be
greeted with roars of laughter. He had leaped into a sheet of
“salt sea foam” which had gathered, and was confined within
a large hoop.</p>

<h3 id="heading161">CELTS—FLINT ARROW-HEADS, ETC.</h3>

<p>The common people believe these to be produced by
thunder, and thrown down from the clouds, and that
they shew what weather will ensue by changing their colour.</p>

<p>I have also found a belief prevailing in many districts,
that Celts impart a virtue to water in which they have been
soaked, and that diseases have been cured by drinking it.</p>

<h3 id="heading162">HORNS ON THE CHURCH TOWER.</h3>

<p>When the masons were building the tower of Towednack
Church, the devil came every night and carried
off the pinnacles and battlements. Again and again this
work was renewed during the day, and as often was it removed
during the night, until at length the builders gave up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the work in despair, feeling that it was of no use to contend
with the evil one.</p>

<p>Thus it is that Towednack Church stands lonely, with its
squat and odd-looking tower, a mark of the power of evil to
the present day. Associated with this tower is a proverb:
“There are no cuckolds in Towednack, because there are no
horns on the church tower.”</p>

<h3 id="heading163">TEA-STALKS AND SMUT.</h3>

<p>Stems of tea floating in that beverage indicate strangers.
Flakes of smut hanging loose to the fire-bars do the
same thing.</p>

<p>The time of the stranger’s arrival may be known by placing
the stem on the back of one hand, and smacking it with the
other; the number of blows given before it is removed indicates
the number of days before his arrival.</p>

<p>The flake of carbon is blown upon, and according as it is
removed by the first, second, or third blow, so is the time at
the end of which the visitor may be expected.</p>

<h3 id="heading164">AN OLD CORNISH RHYME.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When the corn is in the shock,</div>
<div class="verse">Then the fish are on the rock.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The pilchard visits this coast in the early autumn. These
are the “fish” <i>par excellence</i> of the Cornish, and they are thus
distinguished.</p>

<h3 id="heading165">TO CHOOSE A WIFE.</h3>

<p>Ascertain the day of the young woman’s birth, and
refer to the last chapter of Proverbs. Each verse from
the 1st to the 31st is supposed to indicate, either directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
or indirectly, the character, and to guide the searcher—the
verse corresponding with her age indicating the woman’s
character.</p>

<h3 id="heading166">THE ROBIN AND THE WREN.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Those who kill a robin or a wran,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Will never prosper, boy or man.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This feeling is deeply impressed on every young mind;
there are few, therefore, who would injure either of those
birds.</p>

<p>I remember that a boy in Redruth killed a robin: the
dead robin was tied round his neck, and he was marched by
the other boys through the town, all of them singing the
above lines.</p>

<h3 id="heading167">TO SECURE GOOD LUCK FOR A CHILD.</h3>

<p>Give the first person whom you meet between your own
house and the church to which you are taking the infant
to be christened, a piece of bread and salt.</p>

<h3 id="heading168">INNOCENCY.</h3>

<p>To wash the hands is an attestation of innocency. To
call a man “dirty fingers,” is to accuse him of some
foul or unjust deed.</p>

<h3 id="heading169">RAIN AT BRIDAL OR BURIAL.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Blessed is the bride</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Whom the sun shines on,</div>
<div class="verse">Blessed is the dead</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Whom the rain rains on.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If it rains while a wedding party are on their way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
church, or on returning from it, it betokens a life of bickering
and unhappiness.</p>

<p>If the rain falls on a coffin, it is supposed to indicate that
the soul of the departed has “arrived safe.”</p>

<h3 id="heading170">CROWING HENS, ETC.</h3>

<p>A whistling maid and a crowing hen in one house,
is a certain sign of a downfall to some one in it. I
have known hens killed for crowing by night.</p>

<p>The braying of an ass is a sign of fair weather; so is also
the crowing of a cock. The quacking of ducks foretells rain.</p>

<h3 id="heading171">THE NEW MOON.</h3>

<p>To see the new moon for the first time, through glass, is
unlucky; you may be certain that you will break glass
before that moon is out. I have known persons whose attention
has been called to a clear new moon, hesitate. “Hev I
seed her out a’ doors afore?” if not, they will go into the
open air, and if possible shew the moon “a piece of gold,”
or, at all events, turn their money.</p>

<h3 id="heading172">LOOKING-GLASSES.</h3>

<p>Breaking a looking-glass is certain to insure seven years
of misfortune.</p>

<h3 id="heading173">THE MAGPIE.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“One is a sign of anger,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Two is a sign of mirth,</div>
<div class="verse">Three is a sign of a wedding,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Four is a sign of a {birth.</div>
<div class="verse indent11">{death.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A scolding woman is called a magpie. Whenever you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a magpie, take off your hat to it; this will turn away the
anger.</p>

<h3 id="heading174">THE MONTH OF MAY UNLUCKY.</h3>

<p>May is regarded by many as an unhealthy and unlucky
month.</p>

<p>Children born in the month of May are called “May
chets,” and kittens cast in May are invariably destroyed, for—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“May chets</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A hot May,</div>
<div class="verse">Fat church hay,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">meaning that funerals will be plenty.</p>

<h3 id="heading175">ON THE BIRTHS OF CHILDREN.</h3>

<h3 id="heading176">ON WASHING LINEN.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">They that wash Tuesday are pretty near by,</div>

<div class="verse">They that wash Thursday must wash for their life,</div>
<div class="verse">They that wash Friday must wash in need,</div>
<div class="verse">They that wash Saturday are sluts indeed.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="heading177">ITCHING EARS.</h3>

<p>When the ears are red and itch, it is a sign that some
one is talking of the suffering individual. If it is the
left ear, they are being scandalised; if the right ear, they
are being praised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Often have I heard, when the lower and middle class
people have been indulging in some gossip of their neighbours
or friends, “I’ll bet how their ears do itch.”</p>

<h3 id="heading178">THE SPARK ON THE CANDLE.</h3>

<p>A bright spark on the candle-wick indicates a letter
coming to the house. The person towards whom it
shines will receive it. The time of its arrival is determined
by striking the bottom of the candlestick on the table. If
the spark comes off on the first blow, it will be received to-morrow;
if two blows are required, on the second day, and
so on.</p>

<h3 id="heading179">THE BLUE VEIN.</h3>

<p>A fond mother was paying more than ordinary attention
to a fine healthy-looking child, a boy about three years
old. The poor woman’s breast was heaving with emotion,
and she struggled to repress her sighs. Upon inquiring if
anything was really wrong, she said “the old lady of the
house had just told her that the child could not live long,
because <i>he had a blue vein across his nose</i>.”</p>

<h3 id="heading180">THE CROAKING OF THE RAVEN.</h3>

<p>There is a common feeling that the croaking of a raven
over the house bodes evil to some member of the family.
The following incident, given to me by a really intelligent
man, illustrates the feeling:<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>—</p>

<p>“One day our family were much annoyed by the continued
croaking of a raven over our house. Some of us believed it
to be a token; others derided the idea; but one good lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
our next-door neighbour, said, ‘Just mark the day, and see
if something does not come of it.’ The day and hour were
carefully noted. Months passed away, and unbelievers were
loud in their boastings and inquiries after the token.</p>

<p>“The fifth month arrived, and with it a black-edged letter
from Australia, announcing the death of one of the members
of the family in that country. On comparing the dates of the
death and the raven’s croak, they were found to have occurred
on the same day.”</p>

<h3 id="heading181">WHISTLING.</h3>

<p>To whistle by night is one of the unpardonable sins amongst
the fishermen of St Ives. My correspondent says, “I
would no more dare go among a party of fishermen at night
whistling a popular air than into a den of untamed tigers.”</p>

<p>No miner will allow of whistling underground. I could
never learn from the miners whether they regarded it as
unlucky or not. I rather think they feel that whistling indicates
thoughtlessness, and they know their labour is one of
danger, requiring serious attention.</p>

<h3 id="heading182">MEETING ON THE STAIRS.</h3>

<p>It is considered unlucky to meet on the stairs, and often
one will retire to his or her room rather than run the
risk of giving or receiving ill luck.</p>

<p>I find this superstition prevails also in the Midland
counties.</p>

<h3 id="heading183">TREADING ON GRAVES.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To see a man tread over graves,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So sings Coleridge in his ballad of “The Three Graves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever a person shivers from a sensation of cold down
the spine, it is said some one is walking over his or her grave.</p>

<p>Persons believing this will give directions that they may
be buried in some secluded corner of the churchyard, so that
their corpse may not be disturbed by unholy footsteps.</p>

<h3 id="heading184">A LOOSE GARTER.</h3>

<p>If an unmarried woman’s garter loosens when she is walking,
her sweetheart is thinking of her.</p>

<h3 id="heading185">TO CURE THE HICCOUGH.</h3>

<p>Wet the forefinger of the right hand with spittle, and
cross the front of the left shoe or boot three times,
repeating the Lord’s Prayer backwards.</p>

<h3 id="heading186">THE SLEEPING FOOT.</h3>

<p>This irregularity in the circulation is at once removed by
crossing the foot with saliva.</p>

<h3 id="heading187">THE HORSE-SHOE.</h3>

<p>To nail a horse-shoe, which has been cast on the road, over
the door of any house, barn, or stable, is an effectual
means of preventing the entrance of witches.</p>

<h3 id="heading188">THE BLACK CAT’S TAIL.</h3>

<p>Those little gatherings which occur on the eye-lids of
children, locally called “wilks,” are cured by passing
a black cat’s tail nine times over the place. If a ram cat,
the cure is more certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading189">UNLUCKY THINGS.</h3>

<p>To put the loaf on the table upside down—to cut the
butter at both ends—to place the bellows on the table—to
upset the salt—to cross your knife and fork—to pour
gravy out of a spoon backwards, (or back-handed,) is each
unlucky, and leads to quarrels. To borrow or lend a bellows
is most unlucky, and many would rather give than lend one.</p>

<p>If you are going on an errand, never turn back to your
house, it presages ill luck to do so. If, however, you are
compelled to it, fail not to sit down. By doing this, some
mischief may be avoided.</p>

<h3 id="heading190">THE LIMP CORPSE.</h3>

<p>If a corpse stiffens shortly after death, all is thought to proceed
naturally; but if the limbs remain flexible, some one
of the family is shortly to follow. If the eyes of a corpse are
difficult to close, it is said “they are looking after a follower.”</p>

<p>To find a louse on one’s linen, is a sign of sickness. To
find two, indicates a severe illness. If three lice are so found
within a month, it is a “token to prepare.”</p>

<p>Talking backwards, or putting one word incorrectly before
another,—“the cart before the horse,”—is considered to foretell
that you will shortly see a stranger.</p>

<p>If two young people, in conversation, happen to think of
the same thing at the same time, and one of them utters
the thought before the other, that one is certain to be
married first.</p>

<h3 id="heading191">“BY HOOK OR BY CROOK.”</h3>

<p>In the parish of Egles-Hayle are two crosses, known as
“Peverell’s Crosses;” and near Mount Charles, also in
this parish, is another “moorstone” cross, called the Prior’s
Cross, whereon is cut the figure of a hook and a crook, in
memory of the privileges granted by a prior, belonging to
the family of the Peverells, who are said to have possessed
lands in this parish since the time of Richard II.</p>

<p>The poor of Bodmin were greatly distressed through the
scarcity of fuel, the “turf,” or peat of the moors being insufficient
to supply their wants. The prior gave “privilege
and freedom” to the poor of Bodmin for gathering, for “fire-boote
and house-boote,” such boughs and branches of oak-trees
in his woods of Dunmear, as they could reach to, or
come at, with a “hook and a crook,” without further damage
to the trees.</p>

<p>Hence the proverb concerning filching, “that they will
have it by hook or by crook.”</p>

<h3 id="heading192">WEATHER SIGNS.</h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Weather Dog</span>.—It frequently happens in unsettled
weather that banks of rain-cloud gather around the
horizon, and that, over isolated tracts, the rain falls. If these
depositions from this low stratum of clouds occur opposite to
the sun, the lower limb of a bow is formed, often appearing
like a pillar of decomposed light; and sometimes two of these
coloured bands will be seen, forming indeed the two extremities
of the arch. These are “weather dogs,” and they are
regarded as certain prognostications of showery or stormy
weather.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual proverb with regard to the full bow; which prevails
generally, is common in Cornwall,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The rainbow in the morning</div>

</div>

<h3 id="heading194">THE FIRST BUTTERFLY.</h3>

<p>“One of the superstitions prevailing in Devonshire is,
that any individual neglecting to kill the first butterfly
he may see for the season, will have ill luck throughout the
year.”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The following recent example is given by a young
lady:—“The other Sunday, as we were walking to church,
we met a man running at full speed, with his hat in one hand,
and a stick in the other. As he passed us he exclaimed, ‘I
shan’t hat ’en now, I b’lieve.’ He did not give us time to
inquire what he was so eagerly pursuing; but we presently
overtook an old man, whom we knew to be his father, and
who, being very infirm, and upwards of seventy, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
hobbled about by the aid of two sticks. Addressing me, he
observed, ‘My <i>zin</i> a took away wan a my sticks, miss; wan’t
be ebble to kill’n now though, I b’lieve.’ ‘Kill what?’ said
I. ‘Why, ’tis a butterfly, miss,—the <i>furst</i> hee’th a zeed for
the year; and they zay that a body will have cruel bad luck
if a ditn’en kill a <i>furst</i> a zeeth.’”</p>

<p>I have found this belief prevailing in the east, but never
in the west, of Cornwall.</p>

<h3 id="heading195">PECULIAR WORDS AND PHRASES.</h3>

<p>“The people in the west,” writes a correspondent, “have
adopted many words from the Danish invaders.”
Tradition assures us that the sea-rovers of the North frequently
landed at Witsand Bay, burned and pillaged the
villages of Escols and Mayon, sometimes took off the women,
but never made a settlement. Certain red-haired families
are often referred to as Danes, and the dark-haired people
will not marry with “a red-haired Dane.” He continues:—“If
you were in Buryan Church-town this evening, you
might probably hear Betty Trenoweth say, ‘I’ll take off my
<i>touser</i>, [toute serve,] and run up to Janey Angwins to <i>cousey</i>
[causer] a spell; there’s a lot of boys gone in there, so
there’ll be a grand <i>courant</i>, [de courir,] I expect.’ In a
short time Betty may come back disappointed, saying,
‘’Twas a mere <i>cow’s courant</i> after all, cheld vean—all
hammer and tongs.’”</p>

<p>The <i>touser</i> is a large apron or wrapper to come quite
round and keep the under garments clean. By a <i>courant</i>
with the boys, they mean a game of running romps. It is
not at all uncommon in other parts of the country to hear
the people say, “It was a fine <i>courant</i>,” “We’ve had a good
<i>courant</i>,” when they intend to express the enjoyment of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
pleasure party. These are, however, probably more nearly
allied to Norman-French.</p>

<p>There are some proverbial expressions peculiar to the
west:—</p>

<p>“Sow barley in dree, and wheat in pul.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>“To make an old nail good, right it on wood.”</p>

<p>“Fill the sack, then it can stand.”</p>

<p>The last meaning that neither man nor beast can work on
an empty stomach.</p>

<p>The following are a few of less common expressions, preserving
remarkable words:—</p>

<p>’Tis not <i>bezibd</i>—It is not allotted me.</p>

<p>He will never <i>scrip</i> it—He will never escape it.</p>

<p>He is nothing <i>pridy</i>—He is not handsome.</p>

<p>Give her <i>dule</i>—Give her some comfort or consolation.</p>

<p>Hark to his <i>lidden</i>—Listen to his word or talk.</p>

<p>It was <i>twenty</i> or <i>some</i>—It was about twenty.</p>

<p>The wind brings the <i>pilme</i>—The wind raises the dust.</p>

<p>How thick the <i>brusse</i> lies—How thick the dust lies.</p>

<p>He is <i>throyting</i>—He is cutting chips from sticks.</p>

<p>He came of a good <i>havage</i>—He belongs to a good or
respectable family.</p>

<p><i>Hame</i>—a straw collar with wooden collar-trees, to which
are fastened the rope traces.</p>

<p><i>Scalpions</i> (<i>buckthorn</i>, or rather <i>buckhorn</i>)—salt dried fish,
usually the whiting.</p>

<p>“Eating fair maids, or fermades—(<i>fumadoes</i>)—[pilchards,]
and drinking mahogany, [gin and treacle.]”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">To this day the tower of Forrabury Church, or, as
it is called by Mr Hawker, “the silent tower of
Bottreaux,” remains without bells. “At Forrabury
the chimes have never sounded for a
marriage, the knell has never been heard for a funeral.”—<i>Collins.</i></p>

<p>In days long ago, the inhabitants of the parish of Forrabury—which
does not cover a square mile, but which now
includes the chief part of the town of Boscastle and its harbour—resolved
to have a peal of bells which should rival
those of the neighbouring church of Tintagel, which are said
to have rung merrily at the marriage, and tolled solemnly at
the death, of Arthur.</p>

<p>The bells were cast; the bells were blessed; and the bells
were shipped for Forrabury. Few voyages were more
favourable; and the ship glided, with a fair wind, along the
northern shores of Cornwall, waiting for the tide to carry
her safely into the harbour of Bottreaux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The vesper bells rang out at Tintagel, and the pilot, when
he heard the blessed sound, devoutly crossed himself, and
bending his knee, thanked God for the safe and quick
voyage which they had made.</p>

<p>The captain laughed at the superstition of the pilot, as he
called it, and swore that they had only to thank themselves
for the speedy voyage, and that, with his arm at the helm,
and his judgment to guide them, they should soon have a
happy landing. The pilot checked this profane speech; but
the wicked captain—and he swore more impiously than ever
that all was due to himself and his men—laughed to scorn
the pilot’s prayer. “May God forgive you!” was the pilot’s
reply.</p>

<p>Those who are familiar with the northern shores of Cornwall
will know that sometimes a huge wave, generated by
some mysterious power in the wide Atlantic, will roll on,
overpowering everything by its weight and force.</p>

<p>While yet the captain’s oaths were heard, and while the
inhabitants on the shore were looking out from the cliffs,
expecting, within an hour, to see the vessel, charged with
their bells, safe in their harbour, one of these vast swellings
of the ocean was seen. Onward came the grand billow in
all the terror of its might. The ship rose not upon the
waters as it came onward. She was overwhelmed, and sank
in an instant close to the land.</p>

<p>As the vessel sank, the bells were heard tolling with a
muffled sound, as if ringing the death-knell of the ship and
sailors, of whom the good pilot alone escaped with life.</p>

<p>When storms are coming, and only then, the bells of
Forrabury, with their dull, muffled sound, are heard from
beneath the heaving sea, a warning to the wicked; and
the tower has remained to this day silent.</p>

<h3 id="heading197">THE TOWER OF MINSTER CHURCH.</h3>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Hawker.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On a visit to this old church, which is allowed to perish
under the influences of damp and the accompanying
vegetable growth, in a way which is but little creditable to
the parishioners, I was struck at the evidence that the tower
had either been taken down or that it had fallen. Amidst
the long grass of the churchyard I found many remains of
carved stones, which clearly belonged at one time to the
tower. I sought for some information, but I could obtain
none. The officiating clergyman, and several gentlemen of
Boscastle, were alike ignorant of any tradition connected
with the tower—the prevalent idea being that it was left
unfinished.</p>

<p>At length, the ostler at the inn informed me that the
story of the destruction of the tower ran thus:—</p>

<p>The tower of the church of the ancient abbey was seen
through the gorge which now forms the harbour of Boscastle,
far out at sea. The monks were in the habit of placing a
light in one of the windows of the tower to guide the worshippers,
at night, to the minster.</p>

<p>Frequently sailors mistook this, by day for some landmark,
and at night for a beacon, and were thus led into a
trap from which they could not easily extricate themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and within which they often perished. This accident
occurred so frequently that the sailors began at last to declare
their belief that the monks purposely beguiled them
to their fate, hinting, indeed, that plunder was their object.
Eventually, a band of daring men, who had been thus
lured into Boscastle, went to the abbey, and, in spite of the
exertions made by the monks, they pulled down the tower,
since which time it has never been rebuilt.</p>

<h3 id="heading198">TEMPLE MOORS.</h3>

<p>The parish of Temple in 1851 had a population of 24.
Yet once the Knights Templars built a church here;
and with the purpose of civilising the inhabitants of the
moors in the midst of which it was founded, they secured
for their temple some special privileges. “Many a bad
marriage bargain,” says Tonkin, “is there yearly slubbered
up, and grass widows with their fatlings put to lie-in and
nurse here.” “Send her to Temple Moors,” implied that
any female requiring seclusion might at one time secure it
under the charge of these Christian knights in this their
preceptory, and be returned to the world again, probably, in
all respects, a better woman. At all events, the world, being
in ignorance, did not repudiate the erring sister.</p>

<p>Stories linger over this wilderness of mixed good and evil.
The church, which was consecrated to the great cause of
saving sinners, has perished. No stone remains to tell us
where it stood; and to “send her to Temple Moors,” is to
proclaim a woman an outcast from society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading199">THE LEGEND OF TAMARA.</h3>

<p>The lovely nymph Tamara was born in a cavern. Although
her parents were spirits of the earth, the child loved
the light of day. Often had they chided her for yielding to
her desires and visiting the upper world; and often had they
warned her against the consequences which would probably
arise from her neglect of their advice.</p>

<p>The giants of the moors were to be feared; and it was
from these that the earth spirits desired to protect their child.</p>

<p>Tamara—beautiful, young, heedless—never lost an opportunity
of looking on the glorious sun. Two sons of Dartmoor
giants—Tavy and Tawrage—had seen the fair maid,
and longed to possess her. Long was their toil, and the
wild maiden often led them over mountain and moor in
playful chase.</p>

<p>Under a bush in Morewinstow, one day, both Tavy and
Tawrage came upon Tamara. They resolved now to compel
her to declare upon which of them her choice should fall.
The young men used every persuasion, and called her by
every endearing name. Her parents had missed Tamara,
and they sought and found her seated between the sons of
the giants whom they hated. The gnome father caused a
deep sleep to fall on the eyes of Tavy and Tawrage, and
then he endeavoured to persuade his daughter to return to
his subterranean cell.</p>

<p>Tamara would not leave her lovers. In his rage the
gnome cursed his daughter, and, by the might of his curse,
changed her into a river, which should flow on for ever to
the salt sea. The lovely Tamara dissolved in tears, and, as
a crystal stream of exceeding beauty, the waters glided onward
to the ocean.</p>

<p>At length Tavy awoke. His Tamara was gone; he fled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
to his father in the hills. The giant knew of the metamorphosis,
and, to ease the anguish of his son, he transformed
him into a stream. Rushing over rocks, running through
morasses, gliding along valleys, and murmuring amidst the
groves, Tavy still goes on seeking for Tamara—his only joy
being that he runs by her side, and that, mingling their
waters, they glide together to the eternal sea.</p>

<p>Tawrage awakened after a long sleep. He divined what
had taken place, and fled to the hills to an enchanter. At
his prayer he, too, was changed to a stream; but he mistook
the road along which Tamara had gone, and onward, ever
sorrowing, he flows—away—away—away from his Tamara
for ever.</p>

<p>Thus originated the Tamar, the Tavy, and the Taw.</p>

<h3 id="heading200">THE CHURCH AND THE BARN.</h3>

<p>The Daunays were great people in their day; but many
of them bore indifferent characters.</p>

<p>Sir John de Daunay was a strange mixture of ostentatious
pride and penuriousness. His Lady Emelyn was as proud
as her husband, but extravagant to a fault.</p>

<p>The priests of St Germans persuaded Sir John to build a
church on his lands at Sheviock. He commenced the work,
and, notwithstanding his great wealth, his heart failed him
and he curtailed the fair proportions on which he had at
first decided.</p>

<p>Emelyn was enraged at this; and it is said, that, prompted
by the devil in visible presence, she resolved to build a barn
which should exceed in beauty the house of God.</p>

<p>The barn rose with astonishing rapidity. Stones were
laid at night, and the work proceeded as if the most lavish
expenditure had been bestowed upon it. The church progressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
but slowly, and was, after all, a very inferior structure
to the barn. The devil, without doubt, having assisted
Lady Daunay in her wicked work.</p>

<p>“There runneth a tale amongst the parishioners how
one of the Daunay family’s ancestors undertook to build
the church, and the wife the barn adjoining; and that, casting
up accounts on finishing their work, the barn was found
to have cost 1½d. more than the church.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The Daunay aisle in Sheviock Church still preserves the
name of this family, who appear to have possessed at one
time nearly all this, and much of the adjoining parish.</p>

<h3 id="heading201">THE PENRYN TRAGEDY.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“News from Penryn, in Cornwall, of a most bloody and unexampled Murder.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such was the title of a black-letter pamphlet of eight
pages referred to by Lysons. This curious book does
not appear to be in existence.</p>

<p>Mr Davies Gilbert, who possessed much property in the
parish of Gluvias, was especially interested in the farm of
Bohelland, the place which has been rendered for ever notorious,
as having been the scene of Lillo’s tragedy of
“Fatal Curiosity.”</p>

<p>From a work entitled “The Reign and Death of King
James of Great Britain,” Mr Gilbert quotes as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He had been blessed with ample possessions and fruitful issue, unhappy
only in a younger son, who, taking liberty from his father’s bounty, and
with a crew of like condition, that wearied on land, they went roving to
sea, and in a small vessel southward, took boot from all they could master.
And so increasing force and wealth, ventured on a Turk’s man in the
Streights; but by mischance their own powder fired themselves, and our
gallant, trusting to his skilful swimming, got on shore upon Rhodes; with
the best of his jewels about him; where, offering some to sale to a Jew, who
knew them to be the Governor’s of Algier, he was apprehended, and, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
pirate, sentenced to the galleys among other Christians, whose miserable
slavery made them all studious of freedom, and with wit and valour took
opportunity and means to murder some officers, got on board of an English
ship, and came safe to London; where his misery, and some skill,
made him servant to a surgeon, and sudden preferment to the East Indies.
There, by this means, he got money; with which returning back, he
designed himself for his native county, Cornwall. And in a small ship
from London, sailing to the west, was cast away upon that coast. But his
excellent skill in swimming, and former fate to boot, brought him safe to
shore; where, since his fifteen years’ absence, his father’s former fortunes
much decayed, now retired him not far off to a country habitation, in debt
and danger.</p>

<p>“His sister he finds married to a mercer, a meaner match than her birth
promised. To her, at first, he appears a poor stranger, but in private
reveals himself, and withal what jewels and gold he had concealed in a
bow-case about him; and concluded that the next day he intended to appear
to his parents, and to keep his disguise till she and her husband should
meet, and make their common joy complete. Being come to his parents,
his humble behaviour, suitable to his suit of clothes, melted the old couple
to so much compassion as to give him covering from the cold season under
their outward roof; and by degrees his travelling tales, told with passion to
the aged people, made him their guest so long by the kitchen fire, that the
husband took leave and went to bed. And soon after his true stories
working compassion in the weaker vessel, she wept, and so did he; but
compassionate of her tears, he comforted her with a piece of gold, which
gave assurance that he deserved a lodging, to which she brought him; and
being in bed, shewed her his girdled wealth, which he said was sufficient
to relieve her husband’s wants, and to spare for himself, and being very
weary, fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>“The wife tempted with the golden bait of what she had, and eager of
enjoying all, awakened her husband with this news, and her contrivance
what to do; and though with horrid apprehensions he oft refused, yet her
puling fondness (Eve’s enchantments) moved him to consent, and rise to be
master of all, and both of them to murder the man, which instantly they
did; covering the corpse under the clothes till opportunity to convey it out
of the way.</p>

<p>“The early morning hastens the sister to her father’s house, where she,
with signs of joy, inquires for a sailor that should lodge there the last
night; the parents slightly denied to have seen any such, until she told them
that he was her brother, her lost brother; by that assured scar upon his
arm, cut with a sword in his youth, she knew him; and were all resolved
this morning to meet there and be merry.</p>

<p>“The father hastily runs up, finds the mark, and with horrid regret of this
monstrous murder of his own son, with the same knife cuts his own throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“The wife went up to consult with him, where, in a most strange manner
beholding them both in blood, wild and aghast, with the instrument at
hand, readily rips herself up, and perishes on the same spot.</p>

<p>“The daughter, doubting the delay of their absence, searches for them
all, whom she found out too soon; with the sad sight of this scene, and
being overcome with horror and amaze of this deluge of destruction, she
sank down and died; the fatal end of that family. The truth of which
was frequently known, and flew to court in this guise; but the imprinted
relation conceals their names, in favour to some neighbour of repute and

<p>Mr Harris of Salisbury, in his “Philological Inquiries,”
says of Lillo’s tragedy:—</p>

<p>“It is no small praise to this affecting fable that it so
much resembles the ‘Œdipus Tyrannus’ of Sophocles. In
both tragedies, that which apparently leads to joy, leads in
its completion to misery; both tragedies concur in the horror
of their discoveries, and both in those great outlines of a
truly tragic revolution, (according to the nervous sentiment
of Lillo himself,)—</p>

<h3 id="heading202">GOLDSITHNEY FAIR AND THE GLOVE.</h3>

<p>On the 5th of August, St James’s day, (old style,) a fair
is held here, which was originally held in the Church-town
of Sithney, near Helston.</p>

<p>In olden time the good <i>St Perran the Little</i> gave to the
wrestlers in his parish a glove as the prize, and the winner
of the glove was permitted to collect the market toll on the
day of the feast, and to appropriate the money to his own
use. The winner of the glove lived in the Church-town of
Sithney, and for long long years the right of holding the
fair remained undisputed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the miners of Goldsithney resolved to contest
the prize, and they won it, since which time the fair has
been held in that village, they paying to the poor of the
parish of Sithney one shilling as compensation.</p>

<p>Gilbert remarks, “The displaying of a glove at fairs is an
ancient and widely-extended custom. Mr Lysons says it is
continued at Chester. The editor has seen a large ornamented
glove over the guildhall at Exeter during the
fairs.”<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading203">THE HARLYN PIE.</h3>

<p>“Adjoining the Church of Constantine, in the parish of
St Merryn, was a cottage which a family of the name
of Edwards held for generations, under the proprietors of
Harlyn, by the annual render of a pie, made of limpets,
raisins, and various herbs, on the eve of the festival in
honour of the saint to whom the church was dedicated.
The pie, as I have heard from my family, and from more
ancient members of the family, and from old servants, was
excellent. The Edwards had pursued for centuries the occupation
of shepherds on Harlyn and Constantine commons.
The last died about forty years ago, and the wreck of their
cottage is almost buried in the sand.”<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading204">PACKS OF WOOL THE FOUNDATION OF THE BRIDGE OF
WADEBRIDGE.</h3>

<p>Lovebone was the vicar of Wadebridge, and there was a
ferry across the river. It was a frequent custom for the
farmers to ride their horses and to drive their cattle across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
when the tide was low, and frequently men and beasts were
lost in the quicksands formed on the rising of the tide. A
sad accident of this kind happened, and Lovebone resolved
on building a bridge; as Leland says in his “Itinerary,”
“Then one Lovebone, vicar of Wadebridge, moved with
pitie, began the bridge, and with great paine and studie,
good people putting their help thereto, finished it with xvii
fair and great uniform arches of stone.”</p>

<p>Great was the labour, and frequent the disappointment.
Pier after pier were built, and then they were lost in the
sands. A “fair structure” was visible at night, in the
morning there was no trace of the work of the masons.
Lovebone almost despaired of success, indeed he was about
to abandon the work, when he dreamed that an angel came
with a flock of sheep, that he sheared them, let the wool
fall into the water, and speedily built the bridge upon the
wool.</p>

<p>Lovebone awoke with a new idea. He gathered from the
farmers around, all the wool they would give him, he put it
loosely into packs, placed these thickly upon the sand, and
built his piers. The work remains to this day in proof of
the engineering skill of the suggesting angel.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Quoting Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Knight of the Burning

<p>“Why could you not be content as well as others, with
the Legend of Whittington? or the Life and Death of Sir
Thomas Gresham, with the building of the Royal Exchange?
or the Story of Queen Eleanor, with the rearing of London
Bridge upon woolsacks?”</p>

<h3 id="heading205">THE LAST WOLF IN ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>The extirpation of the wolves, which once existed in every
part of these islands, is an oft-told story.</p>

<p>But it is not generally known that the last native wolf
lived in the forests of Ludgvan, near Penzance. The last of
his race was a gigantic specimen, and terrible was the havoc
made by him on the flocks. Tradition tells us that at last
he carried off a child. This could not be endured, so the
peasantry all turned out, and this famous wolf was captured
at Rospeith, the name of a farm still existing in Ludgvan.</p>

<h3 id="heading206">CHURCHES BUILT IN PERFORMANCE OF VOWS.</h3>

<p>There are several churches which, tradition tells us, owe
their origin to vows made by terrified men that
they would, if relieved from their dangers, build a temple to
God.</p>

<p>Amongst these may be named Brent Tor, thus spoken of
by Mr Bray:—</p>

<p>“The church of Brent Tor is dedicated to St Michael.
And there is a tradition among the vulgar that its foundation
was originally laid at the foot of the hill; but that the
enemy of all angels, the Prince of Darkness, removed the
stones by night from the base to the summit,—probably to
be nearer his own dominion, the air,—but that, immediately
on the church’s being dedicated to St Michael, the patron
of the edifice hurled upon the devil such an enormous mass
of rock, that he never afterwards ventured to approach it.
Others tell us that it was erected by a wealthy merchant,
who vowed, in the midst of a tremendous storm at sea, (possibly
addressing himself to his patron, St Michael,) that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
he escaped, he would build a church on the first land he
descried.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Brent Tor is a very remarkable hill, and can be seen far
off at sea. This may possibly lend some support to the
latter tradition.</p>

<p>St Anthony, in Kerrier, is likewise stated to be the consequence
of a vow. Soon after the Conquest, as some persons
of rank and fortune were coming to England from Normandy,
they were overtaken by a violent storm, from which they expected
immediate destruction. In the midst of their distress,
they directed their prayers to St Anthony, and laid themselves
under a solemn vow to erect a church to his memory,
if he would save them from shipwreck; and that this church
should be erected on the very spot where they should first
get on shore. Driven by the tempest, they were conducted,
by a power fully equal to that which St Anthony might be
supposed to possess, into St Mawes’ harbour, and happily
landed on that very spot where the church now stands. And
it appears that the materials with which the tower is built,
and the situation which the church and tower occupy, are
calculated to give sanction to this tradition.</p>

<h3 id="heading207">BOLAIT, THE FIELD OF BLOOD.</h3>

<p>Tradition asserts that it was on the spot, so called in
the parish of Burian, that the last battle was fought
between the Cornish Britons and Athelstan. This is in
some measure confirmed by the discovery of flint arrow-heads,
in considerable quantities, from time to time, in and
near this “field of slaughter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>We have little beyond the evidence of tradition to guide
us in regard to any of the triumphs of Athelstan in Cornwall.
It appears tolerably certain that this Saxon king confined the
Cornish Britons to the western side of the Tamar; thus
breaking up the division known as Danmonium, and limiting
the territory over which the kings of the west ruled.</p>

<p>Scattered over Cornwall, we have the evidence, in the
names of places, of Saxon possession. In all probability
these were the resting-places of portions of the Saxon army,
or the district in which fortified camps were placed by Athelstan,
to restrain a turbulent people. Be this as it may, the
battle at Bolait is said to have raged from morning until
night, and then, overpowered by numbers, the Cornish who
still survived fled to the hills, and thus left Athelstan the
conqueror.</p>

<p>It was after this fight that Athelstan, seeing the Islands
of Scilly illumined by the setting sun, determined, if possible,
to achieve their conquest. He then recorded his vow, that
he would, if he returned victorious, build a church, which
should be dedicated to St Buryana. Of this church Hals
writes as follows:—</p>

<p class="center">“BURIAN.</p>

<p>“This church was founded and endowed by King Athelstan,
about the year 930, after such time as he had conquered
the Scilly Islands, as also the county of Devon, and made
Cornwall tributary to his sceptre. To which church he gave
lands and tithes of a considerable value for ever, himself
becoming the first patron thereof, as his successors the kings
of England have been ever since; for which reason it is still
called the royal rectory, or regal rectory, and the royal or
regal peculiar; signifying thereby that this is the church or
chapel pertaining to the king, or immediately under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
jurisdiction of him, as the supreme ordinary from whom
there is no appeal; whereas other peculiars, though exempt
from the visitation or jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop
within whose see they stand, yet are always subject to the
provincial Archbishops of Canterbury and York, or other
persons.</p>

<p>“This church or college consisted of canons, Augustines or
regular priests, and three prebendaries, who enjoyed the
revenues thereof in common, but might not marry; and the
lord chancellors of England of old visited this peculiar—which
extended only over the parishes of Burian, Sennen,
and St Levan—for the king.</p>

<p>“One of the Popes of Rome, about the time of Edward III.,
obtruded upon this church, the canons and prebends thereof,
a dean to be an inspector and overseer over them,—whom he
nominated to be the Bishop of Exon for the time being,—who
for some time visited this church as its governor, as the
lord chancellor did before; which encroachment of the
Pope being observed by Edward III., as appears from the
register of the writs, folio 40 and 41, 8 Edward III., rot. 97,
this usurpation of the Pope was taken away.”</p>

<h3 id="heading208">WOEFUL MOOR, AND BODRIGAN’S LEAP.</h3>

<p>The Bodrigans, from a very early period, were connected
with the borough of Looe. Otto, or Otho de Bodrigan,
was lord of the manor of Pendrim and Looe in the reign of
Edward II. Another Otho de Bodrigan was Sheriff of Cornwall
in the 3d of Richard II., <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1400.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Bodrigan was “attaynted for taking part with
King Richard III. against Henry VII.; and, after flying into
Ireland, Sir Richard Egecombe, father of Sir Pears Egecombe,
had Bodrigan, and other parcels of Bodrigan’s lands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and Trevanion had part of Bodrigan’s lands, as Restronget
and Newham, both in Falmouth Haven.”</p>

<p>On the Barton of Bodrigan there exists what are evidently
the remains of ancient fortifications, and near them a piece
of waste land known as the <i>Woeful Moor</i>.</p>

<p>Here Sir Henry Edgecombe and Trevanion defeated the
great Bodrigan. He fled, and tradition preserves, on the
side of the cliff, the spot known as Bodrigan’s leap, from
which he leapt into the sea, and swam to a ship which kept
near the shore. As he leapt the precipice, he bequeathed,
with a curse, “his extravagance to the Trevanions, and his
folly to the Edgecombes.”</p>

<p>These families divided between them an estate said to be
worth, in those days, £10,000 per annum.</p>

<p>“At that period in our history when the law of the strongest
was the rule, three families in Cornwall were engaged
in a series of domestic wars; these were Bodrigan,
Trevanion, and Edgecumbe. And when Richard the Third
obtained sovereign power, on the division which then took
place in the York faction, Bodrigan endeavoured to seize the
property of Edgecumbe, with little respect, as it would seem,
for the life of the possessor; but in the final struggle at
Bosworth Field, where Henry Tudor put an entire end to
this contest for power under the guise of property, by seizing
the whole to himself, Trevanion and Edgecumbe had the
good fortune to appear on the winning side, and subsequently
availed themselves to the utmost of belligerent rights
against Bodrigan, as he had attempted to do before against
them. The last of that family was driven from his home,
and seems to have perished in exile. His property was
divided between the two families opposed to him, and, after
the lapse of three hundred and fifty years, continues to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a large portion of their respective possessions.”—<i>Gilbert</i>, vol.
iii., p. 204.</p>

<p>William de Bodrigan was lord of the manor of Restronget,
in the 12th of Henry IV. The family possessed it till the
beginning of the reign of Henry VII., when, on the attainder
of Bodrigan, it was given to William Trevanion.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading209">PENGERSWICK CASTLE.</h3>

<p>This castellated building—for it does not now admit of
being called a castle, notwithstanding its embattled
turrets and its machicolated gate—is situated in a hollow
running down to Pengerswick Cove, in the Mount’s Bay,
where there never could have been anything to defend; and
certainly there is nothing to induce any one to incur the
cost of such a building.</p>

<p>Mr Milliton, in the reign of Henry VIII., slew in the
streets of London a man in a drunken brawl. He fled, and
went to sea. It is not known to what part of the world he
went, but we are told that he became excessively rich; so
rich, indeed, that “when he loaded his ass with his gold, the
weight was so great as to break the poor animal’s back.”
Returning to his country, and not daring to appear in any
of the large towns, he bought the manor of Pengerswick, and
built this castle, to defend himself, in the event of his being
approached by any of the officers of the law.</p>

<p>A miserable man, Milliton is said to have lived in a secret
chamber in this tower, and to have been visited only by his
most trusted friends. Deeply deploring the crime that had
condemned him to seclusion from the world, he spent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
dreary hours in ornamenting his dwelling. His own story
is supposed to be told in the painting of an overladen ass
in one room, with a black-letter legend, importing that a
miser is like an ass loaded with riches, who, without attending
to his golden burden, feeds on thistles. There is also a
carving of water wearing a hollow in a stone, and under it
the word “Perseverance.” Of the death of Milliton we have
no account.</p>

<p>There is very little doubt but that Pengerswick Castle is
very much older than the time of Milliton; indeed tradition
informs us that he purchased the place. The legends previously
given, and others in my possession, refer to a much
earlier period. This castle was, it is said, surrounded by
trees; but John Hals, who inherited the property, had all
the timber cut down and sold.</p>

<h3 id="heading210">THE CLERKS OF CORNWALL.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>“In the last age there was a familiarity between the parson
and the clerk and the people which our feelings of
decorum would revolt at—<i>e.g.</i>, ‘I have seen the ungodly
flourish like a <i>green bay</i>-tree.’ ‘How can that be, maister?’
said the clerk of St Clement’s. Of this I was myself an ear-witness.”</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>“At Kenwyn, two dogs, one of which was the parson’s,
were fighting at the west end of the church; the parson, who
was then reading the second lesson, rushed out of the pew
and went down and parted them; returning to his pew, and
doubtful where he had left off, he asked the clerk, ‘Roger,
where was I?’ ‘Why, down parting the dogs, maister,’ said
Roger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>“At Mevagizzey, when non-resident clergymen officiated,
it was usual with the squire of the parish to invite them to
dinner. Several years ago, a non-resident clergyman was
requested to do duty in the church of Mevagizzey on a Sunday
when the Creed of St Athanasius is directed to be read.
Before he had begun the service, the parish clerk asked him
whether he intended to read the Athanasian Creed that morning.
‘Why?’ said the clergyman. ‘Because if you do, no
dinner for you at the squire’s, at Penwarne.’”</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>“A very short time since parish clerks used to read the
first lesson. I once heard the St Agnes clerk cry out, ‘To
the mouth of the burning <i>viery vurnis</i>, and spake, and said,
Shadrac, Meshac, and Abednego, <i>com voath and com hether</i>,’
(Daniel iii.)”</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p>“The clerk of Lamorran, in giving out the psalm, ‘Like
a timorous bird to distant mountains fly,’ always said, ‘Like
a timmersum burde,’ &amp;c., &amp;c., with a shake of the head, and a
quivering voice, which could not but provoke risibility.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading211">A FAIRY CAUGHT.</h3>

<p>The following, communicated to me on the 8th of August,
is too good to be lost. I therefore give it in my correspondent’s
own words:—</p>

<p>“I heard last week of three fairies having been seen in
Zennor very recently. A man who lived at the foot of
Trendreen hill, in the valley of Treridge, I think, was cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
furze on the hill. Near the middle of the day he saw one of
the small people, not more than a foot long, stretched at full
length and fast asleep, on a bank of griglans, (heath,) surrounded
by high brakes of furze. The man took off his
furze cuff, and slipped the little man into it, without his waking
up; went down to the house; took the little fellow out of
the cuff on the hearthstone, when he awakened, and seemed
quite pleased and at home, beginning to play with the children,
who were well pleased with the small body, and called
him Bobby Griglans.</p>

<p>“The old people were very careful not to let Bob out
of the house, or be seen by the neighbours, as he promised
to shew the man where the crocks of gold were buried
on the hill. A few days after he was brought from the
hill, all the neighbours came with their horses (according
to custom) to bring home the winter’s reek of furze, which
had to be brought down the hill in trusses on the backs of
the horses. That Bob might be safe and out of sight, he
and the children were shut up in the barn. Whilst the
furze-carriers were in to dinner, the prisoners contrived to
get out, to have a “courant” round the furze-reek, when they
saw a little man and woman, not much larger than Bob,
searching into every hole and corner among the trusses that
were dropped round the unfinished reek. The little woman
was wringing her hands and crying, ‘Oh, my dear and tender
Skillywidden, wherever canst ah (thou) be gone to? shall I
ever cast eyes on thee again? ‘Go ’e back,’ says Bob to the
children; ‘my father and mother are come here too.’ He then
cried out, ‘Here I am, mammy!’ By the time the words
were out of his mouth, the little man and woman, with their
precious Skillywidden, were nowhere to be seen, and there
has been no sight nor sign of them since. The children got
a sound thrashing for letting Skillywidden escape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading212">THE LIZARD PEOPLE.</h3>

<p>There is a tradition that the Lizard people were formerly
a very inferior race. In fact it is said that they went
on all fours, till the crew of a foreign vessel, wrecked on the
coast, settled among them, and improved the race so much
that they became as remarkable for their stature and physical
development as they had been before for the reverse. At
this time, as a whole, the Lizard folks certainly have among
them a very large population of tall people, many of the men
and women being over six feet in height.</p>

<h3 id="heading213">PRUSSIA COVE AND SMUGGLERS’ HOLES.</h3>

<p>Smugglers’ hiding-places (now, of course, unused) are
numerous. On the banks of the Helford river are
several, and two or three have lately been discovered on the
coast about St Keverne by the falling in of their roofs. In
a part of Penzance harbour, nine years ago, a hiding-place
of this kind was discovered; it still contained one or two
kegs, and the skeleton of a man, with his clothes in good
preservation. It is presumed that the poor fellow while intoxicated
was shut in, and the place never more opened by
his companions. Speaking of Penzance—about fifty years
since, in the back of the harbour, was an old adit called
“Gurmer’s Hole,” and in the cliff over its entrance, <i>on a dark
night</i>, a phosphorescent appearance was always visible from
the opposite side. It could not be seen from beneath, owing
to the projection of the face of the cliff. A fall of the part
taking place, the phenomenon disappeared.</p>

<p>Sixty or seventy years since, a native of Breage called
“Carter,” but better known, from a most remarkable personal
resemblance to Frederick the Great, as the “King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Prussia,” monopolised most of the smuggling trade of the
west. By all accounts he was a man of uncommon mental
power, and chose as the seat of his business a sequestered
rocky cove about two miles east of Marazion, which continues
to bear the name of “Prussia Cove,” and where deep
channels, cut in hard rock, to allow of the near approach of
their boats, still shew the determination of the illicit traders.
Although constantly visited by the excise officers, the “king”
rarely failed to remove his goods, the stocks of which were at
times very large, suffering for a long period comparatively little
from “seizures.” On one occasion his boats, while landing a
cargo, being hard pressed by the revenue cutter, Carter had
some old cannon brought to the edge of the cliff and opened
fire on the unwelcome intruder, and after a short but sharp
engagement, fairly beat her off. The cutter was, of course,
back again early in the morning, and part of the crew, with
the captain, landed; the only traces, however, of the engagement
to be seen was the trampled ground. On approaching
Carter’s house, the officer was met by the “king” himself,
with an angry remonstrance about practising the cutter’s
guns at midnight so near the shore, and disturbing his
family at such unseemly hours. Although the principal
parties concerned were well known, no evidence could be
obtained, and the matter was allowed to drop. Toward the
close of his career, Carter “ventured” in larger ships, became
less successful, and was at last exchequered. He died, at a
very advanced age, in poor circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="heading214">CORNISH TEENY-TINY.</h3>

<p>Mr Halliwell gives us, in his “Popular Rhymes and
Nursery Tales,” the story of Teeny-tiny. In this a
little old woman takes a bone from the churchyard to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
soup. She goes to bed, and puts the bone in the cupboard.
During the night some one comes demanding the bone, and
at length the terrified old woman gives it up.</p>

<p>A similar story is told in Cornwall.</p>

<p>An old lady had been to the church in the sands of Perranzabuloe.
She found, amidst the numerous remains of
mortality, some very good teeth. She pocketed these, and at
night placed them on her dressing-table before getting into
bed. She slept, but was at length disturbed by some one
calling out, “Give me my teeth—give me my teeth.” At
first the lady took no notice of this, but the cry, “Give me
my teeth,” was so constantly repeated, that she at last, in
terror, jumped out of bed, took the teeth from the dressing-table,
and, opening the window, flung them out, exclaiming,
“Drat the teeth, take ’em.” They no sooner fell into the
darkness on the road, than hasty retreating footsteps were
heard, and there were no more demands for the teeth.</p>

<h3 id="heading215">THE SPANIARD AT PENRYN.</h3>

<p>In the reign of James I. there happened to be upon our
coast a Spanish vessel of war. Favoured by the mists
of evening and the growing darkness, the ship entered Falmouth
harbour unseen. The crew armed themselves, and
taking to their boats, proceeded with great caution to the
town of Penryn, situated at the head of the harbour. There
they landed, formed themselves into proper order, and
marched into the town, purposing to plunder the inhabitants
and burn the town. With steady tramp they cautiously
proceeded up the dark main street, resolving to attack the
principal dwellings first. Suddenly a great shout was heard,
drums and trumpets sounded, the noise of many feet rushing
to and fro fell on the ears of the Spaniards. Believing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
they were discovered, and that preparations had been made
for their reception, fear seized them, and they fled precipitately
to their boats and left the town. The martial music
proceeded, however, from a temporary theatre, in which a
troop of strolling players were entertaining the people.</p>

<h3 id="heading216">BOYER, MAYOR OF BODMIN.</h3>

<p>In the reign of Edward VI., Boyer was the mayor of Bodmin,
and he appears to have been suspected of aiding
in an insurrection of the men of Devonshire and Cornwall.
However this may be, Sir Anthony Kingston, provost-marshal
of the king’s army, sent orders to Boyer to have a gibbet
erected in the street opposite his own house by the next day
at noon. He, at the same time, sent his compliments to the
mayor, telling him that he should dine with him, in order to
be present at the execution of some rebels.</p>

<p>The unsuspecting mayor obeyed the command, and at the
time appointed provided an entertainment for his guest.
Kingston put about the wine, and when he observed the
mayor’s spirits were exhilarated, asked him if the gibbet was
ready. Being told that it was, with a wanton and diabolical
sneer he ordered the mayor to be hanged upon it.</p>

<p>At the same time a miller was ordered to be hanged; his
servant was so deeply attached to him, that he went to
Kingston and begged him to spare his master’s life, even if
he hung him in his place. “If you are so fond of hanging,”
said Kingston, “you shall not be disappointed,” and he hanged
the miller and his servant together.</p>

<p>A similar story is told of a mayor of St Ives.</p>

<h3 id="heading217">THOMASINE BONAVENTURE.</h3>

<p>In the reign of Henry VI., about the year 1450, in the
parish of Week St Mary, on the northern coast of Cornwall,
was born of humble parents a girl, to whom the name
of Thomasine was given. This child was in no way distinguished
from other Cornish children; they ever have been,
and still are, remarkable for their healthful beauty, and
Thomasine, like others, was beautiful. Her father was a
small farmer, and the daughter was usually employed in
minding the sheep upon Greenamore, or preventing the geese
from straying too far from his dwelling.</p>

<p>Thomasine appears to have received no education beyond
that which nature gave her. She grew to womanhood a
simple, artless maiden, who knew nothing of the world or
its cares beyond the few sorrows which found their way into
the moorland country of Week and Temple.</p>

<p>Thomasine was watching her flocks when a mounted traveller,
with well-filled saddle-bags, passing over the moors
observed her. Struck by the young woman’s beauty, he
halted and commenced a conversation with her. “Her discreet
answers, suitable to the beauty of her face, much beyond
her rank or degree,” says the quaint Hals, “won upon
him, and he desired to secure her as a servant in his family.”
This traveller, who was a draper from London, sought out
the parents of the shepherdess, and proposed to relieve them
of this daughter, by taking her to the metropolis, promising
her good wages and many privileges; and beyond this he
agreed that, in case he should die, seeing she would be so
far removed from her friends, she should be carefully provided
for.</p>

<p>Having satisfied themselves of the respectability of this
merchant traveller, the parents agreed to part with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
daughter; and Thomasine, full of girlish curiosity to see the
city, of which she had heard, was willing to leave her home.</p>

<p>We next find Thomasine in London as a respected servant
to this city draper. His wife and family are pleased with
the innocent Cornish girl; and by her gentle manners and
great goodness of heart, she won upon all with whom she was
brought in contact. Years passed away, and the draper’s
wife died. In the course of time he proposed to make the
faithful Thomasine his wife. The proposal was accepted, and
“Thomasine and her master were solemnly married together
as man and wife; who then, according to his promise, endowed
her with a considerable jointure in case of her survivorship.”
Within two years of this marriage the draper
died, and Thomasine was left sole executrix. The poor servant,
who but a few years previous was minding sheep on the
moors, was now a rich widow, courted by the wealthy of the
metropolis. With that good sense which appears ever to
have distinguished her, she improved her mind; and following
the examples by which she had been for some time surrounded,
she added to her natural graces many acquired
elegances of manner.</p>

<p>The youth and beauty of the widow brought her numerous
admirers, but all were rejected except Henry Gale, of whom
we know little, save that he was “an eminent and wealthy
citizen.” He was accepted, and Thomasine Gale was the
most toasted of all city madams. After a few years passed
in great happiness, Thomasine became again a widow. Gale
left her all his property, and she became, when not yet
thirty years of age, one of the wealthiest women in London.
So beautiful, so rich, and being yet young, the widow was
soon induced to change her state again. She chose now for
her companion John Percivall, who was already high in the
honours of the corporation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>At the feast of Sir John Collet, who was Lord Mayor in
the second year of the reign of Henry VII., in 1487, Percivall
was the mayor’s carver, “at which time, according to
the custom of that city, Sir John drank to him in a silver
cup of wine, in order to make him sheriff thereof for the
year ensuing, whereupon he covered his head and sat down
at table with the Lord Mayor of London.” John Percivall
was elected Lord Mayor himself in 1499, and he was knighted
in the same year by Henry VII. Sir John Percivall and
Dame Thomasine Percivall lived many years happily together;
but he died, leaving all his fortune to his widow.</p>

<p>Lady Percivall was now advanced in years. She had had
three husbands, but no children. The extraordinary accession
of fortune made no change in her simple honest heart;
the flattery of the great, by whom she had been surrounded,
kindled no pride in the beautiful shepherdess. The home of
her childhood, from which she had been so long separated,
was dear to her, and she retired in her mourning to the quiet
of that distant home.</p>

<p>She spent her declining years in good works. Roads were
made and bridges built at her cost; almshouses for poor
maids were erected; she relieved prisoners; fed the hungry,
and clothed the naked. In Week St Mary, Thomasine founded
a chantry and free school “to pray for the souls of her father
and mother, and her husbands and relatives.” To the school
she added a library, and a dwelling for the chanters and
others, “and endowed the same with £20 lands for ever.”
Cholwell, a learned man and great linguist, was master
here in Henry VIII.’s time; and here he educated in the
“liberal arts and sciences,” says Carew, “many gentlemen’s
sons.” Such were a few of the benefits conferred on Week
by the girl who once had tended the flocks upon the moors;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
but who, by great good fortune, and more by the exercise of
good sense, became Lady Mayoress.</p>

<p>Dame Thomasine Percivall died, respected by all who knew
her, in 1530, having then reached the good old age of eighty
years.</p>

<p>It appears probable that the name Bonaventure, by which
this remarkable female is usually known, was given to her,
likely enough, by the linguist Cholwell, to commemorate her
remarkable fortune.</p>

<p>Berry Comb, in Jacobstow, was once the residence of
Thomasine, and it was given at her death to the poor of St
Mary Week.</p>

<h3 id="heading218">THE LAST OF THE KILLIGREWS.</h3>

<p>Lady Jane, the widow of Sir John Killigrew, sate in
one of the windows of Arwenick House, looking out
upon the troubled waters of Falmouth Harbour. A severe
storm had prevailed for some days, and the Cornish coast
was strewn with wrecks. The tempest had abated; the
waves were subsiding, though they still beat heavily against
the rocks. A light scud was driving over the sky, and a
wild and gloomy aspect suffused all things. There was a
sudden outcry amongst a group of men, retainers of the
Killigrew family, which excited the attention of Lady Jane
Killigrew. She was not left long in suspense as to the cause.
In a few minutes two Dutch ships were seen coming into
the harbour. They had evidently endured the beat of the
storm, for they were both considerably disabled; and with
the fragments of sail which they carried, they laboured
heavily. At length, however, these vessels were brought
round within the shelter of Pendennis; their anchors were
cast in good anchoring-ground; and they were safe, or at
least the crew thought so, in comparatively smooth water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>As was the custom in those days, the boat belonging to
the Killigrew family, manned by the group of whom we have
already spoken, went off as soon as the ships were anchored
and boarded them. They then learnt that they were of the
Hanse Towns, laden with valuable merchandise for Spain, and
that this was in the charge of two Spanish factors. On the
return of the boat’s crew, this was reported to Lady Killigrew;
and she being a very wicked and most resolute woman,
at once proposed that they should return to the ships, and
either rob them of their treasure, or exact from the merchants
a large sum of money in compensation. The rude men, to
whom wrecking and plundering was but too familiar, were
delighted with the prospect of a rare prize; and above all,
when Lady Killigrew declared that she would herself accompany
them, they were wild with joy.</p>

<p>With great shouting, they gathered together as many men
as the largest boat in the harbour would carry, and armed
themselves with pikes, swords, and daggers. Lady Jane
Killigrew, also armed, placed herself in the stern of the boat
after the men had crowded into their places, and with a wild
huzza they left the shore, and were soon alongside of the
vessel nearest to the shore. A number of the men immediately
crowded up the side and on to the deck of this vessel,
and at once seized upon the captain and the factor, threatening
them with instant death if they dared to make any outcry.
Lady Jane Killigrew was now lifted on to the deck of
the vessel, and the boat immediately pushed off, and the
remainder of the crew boarded the other ship.</p>

<p>The Dutch crew were overpowered by the numbers of
Cornishmen, who were armed far more perfectly than they.
Taken unawares as they were, at a moment when they thought
their troubles were for a season at an end, the Dutchmen
were almost powerless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniards were brave men, and resisted the demands
made to deliver up their treasure. This resistance was, however,
fatal to them. At a signal, it is said by some, given
by their leader, Lady Jane Killigrew,—although this was
denied afterwards,—they were both murdered by the ruffians
into whose hands they had fallen, and their bodies cast overboard
into the sea.</p>

<p>These wretches ransacked the ships, and appropriated
whatsoever they pleased, while Lady Jane took from them
“two hogsheads of Spanish pieces of eight, and converted
them to her own use.”</p>

<p>As one of the Spanish factors was dying, he lifted his
hands to Heaven, prayed to the Lord to receive his soul, and
turning to the vile woman to whose villany he owed his
death, he said, “My blood will linger with you until my
death is avenged upon your own sons.”</p>

<p>This dreadful deed was not allowed to pass without notice
even in those lawless times. The Spaniards were then friendly
with England, and upon the representation made by the
Spanish minister to the existing government, the sheriff of
Cornwall was ordered to seize and bring to trial Lady Jane
Killigrew and her crew of murderers. A considerable number
were arrested with her; and that lady and several of her
men were tried at Launceston.</p>

<p>Since the Spaniards were proved to be at the time of the
murder “foreigners under the Queen’s protection,” they were
all found guilty, and condemned to death.</p>

<p>All the men were executed on the walls of Launceston
Castle; but by the interest of Sir John Arundell and Sir
Nicholas Hals, Queen Elizabeth was induced to grant a
pardon for Lady Jane.</p>

<p>How Lady Jane Killigrew lived, and when she died, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
matters on which even tradition, by which the story is preserved,
is silent. We know, however, that her immediate
descendant, John Killigrew, who married one of the Monks,
and his son William Killigrew, who was made a baronet in
1660 by Charles II., were only known for the dissoluteness
of character, and the utter regardlessness of every feeling of
an exalting character, which they displayed. Sir William
Killigrew, by his ill conduct and his extravagant habits,
wasted all the basely-gotten treasure, and sold the manor
and barton of Arwenick to his younger brother, Sir Peter
Killigrew. With the son of this Peter the baronetcy became
extinct. The last Sir Peter Killigrew, however, improved
his fortune by marrying one of the coheirs of Judge
Twisden. Sir Peter and his wife, of whom we know nothing,
died, leaving one son, George Killigrew, who connected
himself with the St Aubyn family by marriage. This man
appears to have inherited many of the vices of his family.
He was given to low company, and towards the close of his
life was remarkable only for his drunken habits.</p>

<p>He was one evening in a tavern in Penryn, surrounded by
his usual companions, and with them was one Walter Vincent,
a barrister-at-law. The wine flowed freely; songs and
loose conversation were the order of the night. At length all
were in a state of great excitement through the extravagance
of their libations, and something was said by George Killigrew
very insultingly to Walter Vincent.</p>

<p>Walter Vincent does not appear to have been naturally a
depraved man, but of violent passions. Irritated by Killigrew,
he made some remarks on the great-grandmother being
sentenced to be hanged. Swords were instantly drawn by
the drunken men. They lunged at each other. Vincent’s
sword passed directly through Killigrew’s body, and he fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
dead in the midst of his revelries, at the very moment when
he was defending the character of her who had brought dishonour
upon them.</p>

<p>This Walter Vincent was tried for the murder of George
Killigrew, but acquitted. We are told by the Cornish historian,
“Yet this Mr Vincent, through anguish and horror at
this accident, (as it was said,) within two years after, wasted
of an extreme atrophy of his flesh and spirits; that, at
length, at the table whereby he was sitting, in the Bishop of
Exeter’s palace, in the presence of divers gentlemen, he instantly
fell back against the wall and died.”</p>

<p>George Killigrew left one daughter; but of her progress
in life we know nothing. Thus the Cornish Killigrews
ceased to be a name in the land.</p>

<p>Such a tale as this does not, of course, exist without many
remarkable additions. Ghosts and devils of various kinds
are spoken of as frequenting Arwenick House, and the
woods around it. Those spectral and demoniacal visitations
have not, however, any special interest. They are only,
indeed, repetitions of oft-told tales.</p>

<h3 id="heading219">SAINT GERENNIUS.</h3>

<p>This reached me at too late a period to be included with
the legends of the saints:—</p>

<p>“The beacon at Veryan stands on the highest ground in
Roseland, at a short distance from the cliff which overlooks
Pendower and Gerrans Bay. Dr Whitaker, in his ‘Cathedral
of Cornwall,’ states it to be one of the largest tumuli in the
kingdom. Its present height above the level of the field in
which it stands is about twenty-eight feet, and its circumference
at the base three hundred and fifty feet; but it must
have been originally much larger, as a considerable portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
on one side has been removed, its summit being now about
eighty feet from the base on the south side, and only fifty
feet on the north, whilst the top of the cairn which was discovered
in it, and which was, no doubt, placed exactly in the
original centre of the mound, is at least ten feet still further
north than the present summit.</p>

<p>“A tradition has been preserved in the neighbourhood,
that Gerennius, an old Cornish saint and king, whose palace
stood on the other side of Gerrans Bay, between Trewithian
and the sea, was buried in this mound many centuries ago,
and that a golden boat with silver oars were used in conveying
his corpse across the bay, and were interred with him.
Part of this tradition receives confirmation from an account
incidentally given of King Gerennius, in an old book called
the ‘Register of Llandaff.’ It is there stated that, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 588,
Teliau, bishop of Landaff, with some of his suffragan bishops,
and many of his followers, fled from Wales, to escape an
epidemic called the yellow plague, and migrated to Dole in
Brittany, to visit Sampson, the archbishop of that place, who
was a countryman and friend of Teliau’s. ‘On his way
thither,’ says the old record, ‘he came first to the region of
Cornwall, and was well received by Gerennius, the king of
that country, who treated him and his people with all honour.
From thence he proceeded to Armorica, and remained there
seven years and seven months; when, hearing that the plague
had ceased in Britain, he collected his followers, caused a
large bark to be prepared, and returned to Wales.’ ‘In
this,’ the record proceeds, ‘they all arrived at the port called
Din-Gerein, king Gerennius lying in the last extreme of life,
who, when he had received the body of the Lord from the
hand of St Teliau, departed in joy to the Lord.’ ‘Probably,’
says Whitaker, in his remarks on this quotation, ‘the royal
remains were brought in great pomp by water from Din-Gerein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
on the western shore of the port, to Carne, about
two miles off on the northern; the barge with the royal body
was plated, perhaps, with gold in places; perhaps, too, rowed
with oars having equally plates of silver upon them; and the
pomp of the procession has mixed confusedly with the interment
of the body in the memory of tradition.’”</p>

<h3 id="heading220">CORNISH DIALOGUE.</h3>

<p>As the Cornish dialogue peculiarly illustrates a description
of literary composition which has no resemblance to
that of any other county, I think it advisable to give one
specimen:—</p>

been the patron saint of St Breage. But there is a Cornish distich,
“Germow Mathern, Breaga Lavethas.” Germoe was a king, Breaga a midwife,
which rather favours the statement that St Breage was a sister of
St Leven. Breage and Germoe are adjoining parishes, having the shores
of the Mount’s Bay for their southern boundaries. When the uncultivated
inhabitants of this remote region regarded a wreck as a “God-send,” and
plundered without hesitation every body, living or dead, thrown upon the
shore, these parishes acquired a melancholy notoriety. The sailors’ popular

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Hals, speaking of Gulval Well, thus describes it and its virtues:—“In
Fosses Moor, part of this manor of Lanesly, in this parish, is that well-known
fountain called Gulval Well. To which place great numbers of
people, time out of mind, have resorted for pleasure and profit of their
health, as the credulous country people do in these days, not only to drink
the waters thereof, but to inquire after the life or death of their absent
friends; where, being arrived, they demanded the question at the well
whether such a person by name be living, in health, sick, or dead. If the
party be living and in health, the still quiet water of the well-pit, as soon
as the question is demanded, will instantly bubble or boil up as a pot, clear
crystalline water; if sick, foul and puddle waters; if the party be dead,
it will neither bubble, boil up, nor alter its colour or still motion. However,
I can speak nothing of the truth of those supernatural facts from my
own sight or experience, but write from the mouths of those who told me
they had seen and proved the veracity thereof. Finally, it is a strong and
courageous fountain of water, kept neat and clean by an old woman of the
vicinity, to accommodate strangers, for her own advantage, by blazing the
virtues and divine qualities of those waters.”—<i>Hals, quoted by Gilbert</i>,

of great bigness, perpendicularly pitched in the earth contiguous with each
other, leaving only a small vacancy downwards, but meeting together at
the top; over all which is laid a flat stone of prodigious bulk and magnitude,
bending towards the east in way of adoration, (as Mr Lhuyd concludes

the Great Barrow, which was cut open by a labourer in search of stones to
build a hedge. He came upon a small hollow, in which he found nine urns
filled with ashes; the man broke them, supposing they were only old
pitchers, good for nothing; but Tonkin, who saw them, believes them to
have been Danish, containing the ashes of some chief commanders slain in
battle; and, says he, on a small hill just under this barrow is a Danish
encampment, called Castle Caer Dane, vulgo Castle Caer Don,—<i>i.e.</i>, the
Danes’ Camp,—consisting of three entrenchments finished, and another begun,
with an intent to surround the inner three, but not completed; and
opposite to this, about a bowshot, the river only running between, on
another hill is another camp or castle, called Castle Kaerkief, castrum
simile, from Kyfel similis, alike alluding to Castle Caer Dane. But this is
but just begun, and not finished in any part, from which I guess there
were two different parties, the one attacking the other before the entrenchments
were finished.</p>

<p>Who was the spirit Gathon?</p>

<p>“The miner starts as he hears the mischievous Gathon answering blow
for blow the stroke of his pickaxe, or deluding him with false fires, noises,
and flames.”—<i>A Guide to the Coasts of Devon and Cornwall. Mackenzie
Walcott, M.A.</i></p>

<p>Carne, in his “Tales of the West,” alludes to this:—“The miners have
their full share of the superstitious feelings of the country, and often hear
with alarm the noises, as it were, of other miners at work deep underground,
and at no great distance. The rolling of the barrows, the sound of
the pickaxes, and the fall of the earth and stones, are distinctly heard
through the night,—often, no doubt, the echo of their own labours; but
sometimes continued long after that labour has ceased, and occasionally
voices seem to mingle with them. Gilbert believed that he was peculiarly
exposed to these visitations; he had an instinctive shrinking from the
place where the accident had happened; and, when left alone there, it was
in vain that he plied his toil with desperate energy to divert his thoughts.
Another person appeared to work very near him: he stayed the lifted pick
and listened. The blow of the other fell distinctly, and the rich ore followed
it in a loud rolling; he checked the loaded barrow that he was
wheeling; still that of the unknown workman went on, and came nearer
and nearer, and then there followed a loud, faint cry, that thrilled through
every nerve of the lonely man, for it seemed like the voice of his brother.
These sounds all ceased on a sudden, and those which his own toil caused
were the only ones heard, till, after an interval, without any warning,
they began again, at times more near, and again passing away to a distance.”—<i>The
Tale of the Miner.</i></p>

<p>The song is by the late C. Taylor Stevens of St Ives, who was for some
time the rural postman to Zennor. I employed Mr Taylor Stevens for
some time collecting all that remains of legendary tales and superstitions
in Zennor and Morva. The net is spelled sometimes Seine at others

ST PIRAN—PERRAN ZABULOE.</h3>

<p>“It is rather a curious circumstance,” says Davies Gilbert,
“that the word <i>Zabuloe</i> added to Perran, for the distinction
of this parish, is not Celtic, but through the French
<i>sable</i>, from <i>sabulum</i>, a word frequently used by Pliny, as
indicative of sand or gravel.</p>

<p>“The encroachments of the sand have caused no less than
three churches to be built, after considerable intervals of
time, in this parish. The last was commenced in 1804; and
in this year, (1835,) a building has been discovered more
ancient than the first of these churches, and not improbably
the oratory of St Perran himself. The length of this chapel
within the walls is 25 feet, without, 30 feet; the breadth
within, 12½ feet; and the height of the walls the same.</p>

<p>“At the eastern end is a neat altar of stone covered
with lime, 4 feet long, by 2½ feet wide, and 3 feet high.
Eight inches above the centre of the altar is a recess in the
wall, where probably stood a crucifix; and on the north side
of the altar is a small doorway, through which the priest
may have entered. Out of the whole length, the chancel
extended exactly 6 feet. In the centre of what may be
termed the nave, in the south wall, occurs a round arched
doorway, highly ornamented. The building is, however,
without any trace of window; and there is only one small
opening, apparently for the admission of air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“The discovery has excited much curiosity throughout the
neighbourhood; which has, unfortunately, manifested itself
by the demolition of everything curious in this little oratory,
to be borne away as relics.”—<i>Gilbert.</i></p>

<p>“Very little is known concerning the saint who has given
his name to the three Perrans. He is, however, held in
great veneration, and esteemed the patron of all Cornwall,
or, at least, of the mining district.”—<i>Hals.</i></p>

<h3 id="appendixB">(B.)<br />
THE DISCOVERER OF TIN.</h3>

<p>By an anachronism of fifteen hundred years or more, St
Perran was considered as the person who first found
tin; and this conviction induced the miners to celebrate his
day, the 5th of March, with so much hilarity, that any one
unable to guide himself along the road has received the appellation
of a Perraner; and that, again, has been most unjustly
reflected as a habit on the saint.</p>

<p>“It may here be worthy of remark, that, as the miners
impute the discovery of tin to St Perran, so they ascribe its
reduction from the ore, in a large way, to an imaginary
person, St Chiwidden; but <i>chi-wadden</i> is white house, and
must, therefore, mean a smelting or blowing house, where
the black ore of tin is converted into a white metal.</p>

<p>“A white cross on a black ground was formerly the
banner of St Perran, and the standard of Cornwall; probably
with some allusion to the black ore and the white metal of
tin.”—<i>Gilbert.</i></p>

<p>A college, dedicated to St Perran, once stood in the parish
of St Kevern, (Dugdale’s “Monasticon,” vol. vi., p. 1449.)
This probably had some connexion with Perran Uthnoe.
The shrine of St Perran was in that parish, which is said to
have contained his head, and other relics.</p>

<p>Lysons quotes a deed in the registry of Exeter, shewing the
great resort of pilgrims hither in 1485.</p>

<p>In the will of Sir John Arundell, 1433, occurs this bequest:—“Item,
lego ad usum parochie S’c’i’ Pyerani in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Zabulo, ad clandendum capud S. Pierani honorificè et meliori
modo quo sciunt xls.”—<i>Collectanea Topogr. et Geneal.</i>,
vol. iii p. 392.</p>

<p>For a full examination of the question, Did the Phœnicians
trade with Britain for tin? the following works should
be consulted:—“History of Maritime and Inland Discovery,”
by W. D. Cooley; “Historical Survey of the Astronomy
of the Ancients,” by Sir George Cornewall Lewis;
“Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients,” by W. Vincent,
D.D.; “Phœnicia,” by John Kenrick, M.A.; “The Cassiterides:
an Inquiry into the Commercial Operations of the
Phœnicians in Western Europe, with particular Reference to
the British Tin Trade,” by George Smith, LL.D., F.A.S.</p>

<h3 id="appendixC">(C.)<br />
ST NEOT.</h3>

<p>The following account of this celebrated saint, as given by
Mr Davies Gilbert, will not be without interest:—</p>

<p>“Multitudes flocked to him from all parts. He founded
a monastery, and repaired to Rome for a confirmation, and
for blessing at the hands of the Pope; these were readily
obtained. He returned to his monastery, where frequent
visits were made to him by King Alfred, on which occasions
he admonished and instructed the great founder of English
liberty; and finally quitted this mortal life on the 31st of
July, about the year 883, in the odour of sanctity so unequivocal
that travellers all over Cornwall were solaced by
its fragrance. Nor did the exertions of our saint terminate
with his existence on earth; he frequently appeared to King
Alfred, and sometimes led his armies in the field. But, if
the tales of these times are deserving of any confidence,
the nation is really and truly indebted to St Neot for one
of the greatest blessings ever bestowed on it. To his advice,
and even to his personal assistance as a teacher, we owe the
foundation by Alfred of the University at Oxford.</p>

<p>“The relics of St Neot remained at his monastery in Cornwall
till about the year 974, when Earl Alric, and his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Ethelfleda, having founded a religious house at Eynesbury,
in Huntingdonshire, and being at a loss for some patron
saint, adopted the expedient of stealing the body of St Neot;
which was accordingly done, and the town retains his name,
thus feloniously obtained, up to this time. The monastery
in Cornwall continued feebly to exist, after this disaster,
through the Saxon times; but, having lost its palladium, it
felt the ruiner’s hand; and, almost immediately after the
Norman Conquest, it was finally suppressed. Yet the
memory of the local saint is still cherished by the inhabitants
of the parish and of the neighbourhood—endeared,
perhaps, by the tradition of his diminutive stature,
reduced, in their imagination, to fifteen inches of height;
and to these feelings we, in all probability, owe the preservation
of the painted glass, the great decoration of this
church, and one of the principal works of art to be seen in
Cornwall.”—<i>Gilbert’s Hist Corn.</i>, vol. iii. p. 262.</p>

MILLINGTON OF PENGERSWICK.</h3>

<p>In the reign of Henry VIII., one Militon, or Millington,
appears to have purchased Pengerswick Castle. This
Millington is said to have retired into the solitude of this
place on account of a murder which he had committed.
(Mr Wilkie Collins appears to have founded his novel of
“Basil” on this tradition.) In all probability a very much
older story is adapted to Mr Millington. So far from his
being a recluse, we learn of his purchasing St Michael’s
Mount, “whose six daughters and heirs invested their husbands
and purchasers therewith.”</p>

<p>That Millington was a man of wealth, and that large
possessions were held by his family, is sufficiently evident.
St Michael’s Mount appears to have been “granted at first
for a term of years to different gentlemen of the neighbourhood.
To Millington, supposed of Pengerswick, in Breage;
to Harris, of Kenegie, in Gulval; and, perhaps jointly with
Millington, to a Billett or Bennett.”—<i>Hals.</i></p>

<h3 id="appendixF">(F.)<br />
SARACEN.</h3>

<p>The term Saracen is always now supposed to apply to the
Moors. This is not exactly correct. Percy, for example,
in his “Essay on the Ancient Minstrels,” says, “The
old metrical romance of ‘Horn Child,’ which, although from
the mention of Saracens, &amp;c., it must have been written, at
least, after the First Crusade, in 1096, yet, from its Anglo-Saxon
language or idiom, can scarcely be dated later than
within a century after the Conquest.” I think this ballad,
and several others of an early date, prove the application of
this term to some Oriental people previous to the Crusades.
Soldàin, soldàn, regarded as a corruption of sultan,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Whoever will fight yon grimme soldàn,</div>
<div class="verse">Right fair his meede shall be,”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is clearly a much older term, applied to any grim Eastern
tyrant, and especially to the Oriental giants. It would not
be a difficult task to shew that the word Saracen, as used in
Cornwall,—“<i>Atal Saracen!</i>” “<i>Oh, he’s a Saracen!</i>” &amp;c.,
was applied to the foreigners who traded with this county
for tin—at a very early period.</p>

found during the great conflict between the King and the Parliament. As illustrations
of County History they are exceedingly interesting. The literary antiquary and the
genealogist will find much new and out-of-the-way matter in them; and there are but
few families in England who cannot claim a relationship to one or other of the names
mentioned in the Royalist or Roundhead lists. <span class="smcap">Only a very few copies have been

<p class="hanging">A Collection of the Names of the Merchants Living
IN AND ABOUT THE CITY OF LONDON; very usefull and
necessary. Carefully Collected for the Benefit of all Dealers that

sight of their name to the place of their abode. London: Printed for

<p>This curious little volume has been reprinted verbatim from one of the only two
copies known to be in existence. It contains an Introduction pointing out some of the
principal persons mentioned in the list. For historical and genealogical purposes the
little book is of the greatest value. Herein will be found the originators of many of
the great firms and copartnerships which have prospered through two pregnant centuries,
and which exist some of them in nearly the same names at this day. Its most
distinctive feature is the early severance which it marks of ‘goldsmiths that keep running
cashes,’ precursors of the modern bankers, from the mass of the merchants of
London. Here also will be found in the general list some of the entertainers of the
wits of their day; Fountain, the father of the wealthy knight with whom Swift was
familiar, as shown in his letters to Stella; Kiffen, the sturdy Baptist, whom James II.
could neither affright nor seduce; Bathurst, with Bragg his connexion, the Vansittarts,
Van Milderts, Ducanes, Beckfords, Papillons, Burdetts, Biddulphs, and Holfords. Here
are Russells, Temples, Palmers, and Harveys, the latter near kinsman of Dr. William
Harvey, who discovered the secret of our own circulation. Only two originals are
known, and one of these recently produced £30 at public auction. The little book is
curious, among other things, as containing the name of Alexander Pope, the father
of the poet, among the merchants residing in Broad Street. The names of the
Messrs. Hoare, the eminent bankers of Fleet Street, at the sign of the ‘Leathern
Bottle’—the house, by the way, where Oliver Cromwell kept his money—occurs in the
Directory, as also do those of the Messrs. Child, the well-known bankers of Temple
Bar. <span class="smcap">Only a very few copies have been reprinted on paper made to resemble

<p>⁂ The most singular designs ever attempted by any artist. This book is a fund of
amusement. So crammed is it with pictures that even the <i>Contents</i> are adorned with
thirty-three illustrations. Now the reader is made to smile at the mishaps of some fat
monks; then a battle scene, with fighting men jammed in inextricable confusion until
the picture becomes painful to look at, occupies his attention; next, some portraits of
fellows who would pass for Pluto’s firemen, all seared, as though they had been for a
thousand years stirring molten lava; then knights making love, and kissing through
their visors; then dreamy old German cities, with diablerie, or satanello, going on
right and left—but all so quaint, so wonderful, that the beholder confesses he never
looked upon the like before.</p>

<p>This book, from the variety and quaintness of the borders surrounding
each page—resembling some of the beautiful early printed Missals—is
worthy of the most elaborate binding. Few modern works sustain the
character of a rich exterior. This volume, on the contrary, on account
of the softness and beauty of the paper, appears to the greatest advantage
in the most brilliant covers. Mr. Hotten has just had some copies

common in England are equally common in the United States; and when we remember
that America began to people two centuries ago, and that these colloquialisms must
have crossed the sea with the first emigrants, we can form some idea of the antiquity
of popular or street language. Many words, owing to the caprices of fashion or
society, have wholly disappeared in the parent country, whilst in the colonies they are
yet heard. The words <span class="smcap">skink</span>, to serve drink in company, and the old term <span class="smcap">miching</span>

<p>⁂ This charming volume of Original Tales has been universally
praised by the critical press. From a great many reviews the following
notices are selected:—</p>

<p>“When children have grown weary of boisterous play, and settled down on chair
and footstool and rug, round the brightly-glowing fire, Mr. Cholmondeley Pennell’s
‘Fairy Tales’ will make their influence felt; cheering them up to renew their joyous
laughter, and eventually sending them to bed with a store of droll fancies and pretty
thoughts—thoughts and fancies which they will think about as they fall asleep, and
dream about as they wake up on the following morning.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“They fully deserve the care which has preserved them, and in their present dress
will afford amusement at the fireside at which they may be read. We may instance in
particular the story of ‘The Blue Fish’ as one of the best Fairy Tales we have seen.
The collection is excellent; the illustrations good.”—<i>London Review.</i></p>

<p>“The tales are of the most charming kind we have read for a long time, and, we
have no doubt, will cheer many a fireside. Our author is as tender as he is quaint and
humorous, and seems to have imbibed the true spirit of fairy and legendary lore. The
illustrations have our heartiest admiration. Miss Edwards works with a pencil as
graceful as it is facile.”—<i>Reader.</i></p>

<p class="hanging">Gog and Magog; or, the History of the Guildhall
Giants. With some Account of the Giants which Guard English and
Continental Cities. By F. W. FAIRHOLT, F.S.A.</p>

<p>WITH ILLUSTRATIONS ON WOOD BY THE AUTHOR,
COLOURED AND PLAIN.</p>

<p>⁂ The critiques which have appeared upon this amusing little work have been
uniformly favourable. The <i>Athenæum</i> pronounces it a perfect model of successful
antiquarian exposition, readable from the first line to the last. The <i>Art Journal</i>
devotes a considerable space to the little work, and congratulates the author upon his
success. The <i>Leader</i> contributes two full pages of eulogy. The <i>Builder</i> directs its
readers to purchase it. The <i>Critic</i> says, in a long article, that it thoroughly explains
who these old Giants were, the position they occupied in popular mythology, the origin
of their names, and a score of other matters, all of much interest in throwing a light
upon fabulous portions of our history.</p>

become candidates for Fellowships at All Souls’ College, Oxford, by virtue of their
consanguinity to Archbishop Chichele, the founder.</p>

<p>This work has long been scarce, the <span class="smcap">supplement extremely</span> so, and has generally
brought at auctions upwards of £2. Mr. Hotten having fortunately lighted upon a
few copies which had lain unnoticed in an old warehouse, bought them in one lot, and
is thus enabled to offer them so much below their intrinsic value. Amongst the
pedigrees occur the descendants of the <span class="smcap">Tracey</span>, <span class="smcap">Digby</span>, <span class="smcap">Shirley</span>, <span class="smcap">Knatchbull</span>, <span class="smcap">Dering</span>,

<p>Only a very limited number of copies have been privately printed by the accomplished
author. A better man could not have been selected to visit the Northern part
of the ancient Principality for the purpose of writing a readable book, descriptive of
its glorious scenery, <i>Traditions, Folk-lore, and Natural Antiquities</i>. All the <i>Ancient
Wells</i>, <i>Castles</i>, <i>Old Houses</i>, <i>Hills</i>, <i>Waterfalls</i>, <i>Caves</i>, <i>Cromlechs</i>, and <i>Druidical Remains</i>
are described. We have, also, some curious particulars about those venerable countrymen
of ours, the <i>old British Giants</i>. <span class="smcap">Ancient Legends</span> and <span class="smcap">Fairy Tales</span> are also
given, together with interesting particulars of the various ascents of Snowdon. It is
an interesting book, and should be offered at 10s. 6d. instead of the 3s. 6d. now asked.

<p class="bookintro">THE ORIGINAL EDITION OF JOE MILLER’S JESTS. 1739.</p>

<p class="hanging">Joe Miller’s Jests; or, the Wit’s Vade Mecum,
being a Collection of the most Brilliant Jests, the politest Repartees,
the most elegant Bons Mots, and most pleasant short Stories in the
English Language. An interesting specimen of remarkable facsimile,
8vo. half morocco, old Dutch paper sides, price 9s. 6d. <i>London:
printed by T. Read</i>, 1739.</p>

<p>The book is well known, or rather the Jests are, for the veritable <i>first edition</i> of Joe
Miller is one of the rarest books in the English language. With regard to the contents
of Joe Miller’s <i>Jests</i>, the plain-spoken words are neither better nor worse than those
in any other similar collection of the period. It is to be regretted that the author did
not employ expressions a little less coarse than he has done: his wit and pungency,
however, it is impossible to deny. Only a very few copies of this humorous book have
been reproduced.</p>

<p class="book">Letters of the Marchioness Broglio Solari, one of

beautifully printed by Whittingham, price 2s. (Intended to have
been sold at 5s.)</p>

<p>The Marchioness Broglio Solari was the natural grand-daughter of Lord Hyde
Clarendon, and consequently one of the collateral branches of the Queens Mary and
Anne, and their grandfather, the great Chancellor of England. She played an important
part in the French Revolution; was the friend of Emperors and Princes;
was intimately acquainted with George the Fourth, Burke, Sheridan, Madame de
Staël, the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, Sir H. Davy, Paganini, &amp;c., of most
of whom she gives characteristic anecdotes. The Marchioness endured many troubles,
was robbed of her fortune, and for some time obtained her living as an actress at the
theatres of London and Dublin. This work was published by an intimate friend, and
the entire impression (with the exception of a few copies) passed into the hands of the
family. It is believed that only 150 copies were printed. The book (by those who
know of its existence) has always been considered as a <i>suppressed work</i>.</p>

<p class="book">Linley’s (Geo., the Song-Writer) Modern Hudibras; a

<p>A rattling satirical poem, the title to which gives a very fair idea of its nature.
Social abuses, the sighs and groans of gentility, the trickeries of literature, the cash-prices
of art and musical criticisms, and a score of other subjects engage his satirical
pen.</p>

<p>It is possible that a passing apprehension that the Louvre might not always be
allowed to retain the Art Treasures for which he had laid most of the countries of
Europe under contribution for its choicest pieces, led <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> to think of forming
this splendid series of Line Engravings, the cost of which, for engraving alone, exceeded
<i>seventy-five thousand pounds sterling</i>, defrayed mostly from the Imperial Treasury.
Since the publication of these volumes many of the paintings and sculptures
have been claimed and restored to their rightful owners; and the dispersion of so
many choice gems enhances the value of the work which describes them in a collected
form.</p>

addition to the scientific knowledge attainable by means of the study of postage
stamps. A table of characters affords the possessor an opportunity of obtaining an
acquaintance with the shape and comparative rarity of stamps. This insight into
the marketable value and scarcity of postage stamps is a new feature in books on the
subject. The exact words of the inscription on the stamps is greatly conducive to
facility of identification, and the queer characters on the Moldavian, Russian, &amp;c.,
stamps, copied without error, demonstrate the extreme care with which the work
must have been got up. The index and money table appended will be found very

<p>⁂ With this work is incorporated <i>The Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and
Vulgar Words</i>, issued by “a London Antiquary” in 1859. The first edition of that
work contained about 3,000 words; the second, issued twelve months later, gave upwards
of 5,000. Both editions were reviewed by the critical press with an approval
seldom accorded to small works of the kind. During the six years that have elapsed,
the compiler has gone over the field of unrecognised English once more. The entire
subject has been resurveyed, outlying terms and phrases have been brought in, new
street-words have been added, and better illustrations of old colloquial expressions
given. The result is the volume before the reader, which offers, for his amusement
or instruction, nearly 10,000 words and phrases commonly deemed “vulgar,” but which
are used by the highest and lowest, the best, the wisest, as well as the worst and most
ignorant of society.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
